      "description": "Spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP is a particular form of Hebbian type of learning which consists in bidirectional modifications of synaptic strength according to the temporal order of pre- and postsynaptic spiking (*Dan Y1, Poo MM (2006) Spike timing-dependent plasticity: from synapse to perception. Physiol Rev 86:1033-1048*). Thus, positively correlated pre- and postsynaptic spiking (pre before post) within a critical window leads to long term potentiation (LTP), whereas a negative correlation (post before pre) leads to long term depression (LTD).  \nAt the neonatal stage, the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 is GABAergic and exhibits STDP. Our data demonstrate that, at the same age, positive pairing fails to induce STD-LTP at MF-CA3 synapses in hippocampal slices obtained from neuroligin-3 (NL3) knock-in (NL3<sup>R451C</sup> KI) and NL3 knock-out (KO) mice. Similarly, in NLR<sup>451C</sup> KI mice, negative pairing failed to cause STD-LTD. In contrast, STD-LTP and STD-LTD can be readily produced in control age-matched WT littermates. In NLR<sup>451C</sup> KI  mice, the impairment in STD-LTP is maintained in adulthood when MF are glutamatergic. This set of data refers to the neonate, NLR<sup>451C</sup> KI, positive pairing condition. \n\n**Embargo status:**   \n*This dataset is temporarily under embargo.

      "description": "A general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments was tested with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. The data used here are obtained from coronal hippocampal slices (300 μm thick) from juvenile (P21-30) C57B16/J male mice receiving input from parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons. The dataset contains 614 individual events recorded from 3 different neurons (expC1-C3). The first column of each txt file contains the time in ms and the other columns contain spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pA.\nComputational modeling of brain circuits requires the definition of many parameters that are difficult to determine from experimental findings. One way to help interpret these data is to fit them using a particular kinetic model. In [1] we proposed a general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments. Starting from any given model description (mod file) in the NEURON simulation environment, the procedure exploits user-defined constraints, dependencies, and rules for the parameters of the model to fit the time course of individual spontaneous synaptic events that are recorded experimentally. A Python version is available for public use, as a Jupyter Notebook in the Collaboratory Portal of the Human Brain Project. To illustrate the potential application of the procedure, we tested its use with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. For individual spontaneous inhibitory events in hippocampal pyramidal CA1 neurons, we found that gephyrin-dependent subcellular pathways may shape synaptic events at different levels, and can be correlated with cell- or event-specific activity history and/or pathological conditions.\nFitting experimental data against a number of different models is a common way to do this (reviewed in [2]), and can help in the subsequent interpretation of the data. In general, experimental traces are fitted using specific approaches for specific purposes (e.g., [3], [4]). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no easy, user-friendly, general procedure available for this purpose, especially in computational neuroscience. Our aim was thus to identify the appropriate conceptual structure of a procedure to obtain good, reliable fits of raw experimental traces of spontaneous synaptic events. This is an important step because spontaneous synaptic events have been so far exclusively analyzed using traces obtained by averaging many events. However, as can be easily imagined, each synapse in any given neuron has its own, independent, history of activation. The most likely physiological consequence is that the variables relative to the subcellular processes underlying synaptic transmission are different for each synapse. If a researcher is interested in testing a specific kinetic scheme implemented for specific biochemical pathways, the use of individual events is the most appropriate choice, since this approach would give information on the different combinations of model parameters that are consistent with the observed events. Averaging traces will lose a lot of relevant information.\nWe therefore present here the implementation of a procedure leading to the development of a unifying optimization method for individual synaptic events. Experimental data, kinetic models of synaptic transmission, and fitting parameters and their dependencies can be user defined/provided or gathered from databases. They can be used to generate optimized groups of parameters able to represent a population of synapses, either for simulation purposes or to study the functional consequences of a particular protein or subcellular synaptic transmission pathway. \n[1] Lupascu CA, Morabito A, Merenda E, et al.

The datasets contain the continuous measure of extracellular potentials at each electrode sampled at 30 kHz, the local field potentials sampled at 1 kHz and the timing of the online and offline extracted spike times. It also includes the timing of several task-related and behavioral events recorded along with the electrophysiological data. Finally, the datasets provide a complete set of metadata structured in a standardized format. These metadata allow easy access to detailed information about the datasets such as the settings of the recording hardware, the array specifications, the location of the implant in the motor cortex, information about the monkeys, or the offline spike sorting. The two datasets can be exploited to address crucial issues in neurophysiology such as: What are the principles of neural interactions in a local cortical network and how are these interactions modulated during a well-described behavioral task? How different neuronal signals such as single-unit activity, multi-unit activity or LFPs relate to each other? Which spike sorting methods provide the best estimate of single unit activity?

The cells in the dataset were labeled using state-of the art viral vectors able to drive massive levels of expression of marker proteins in a neuron after a single transfection event, leaving the rest of the brain unlabeled. This allows the unambiguous visualization /measurement of the entire axonal tree, no matter how large or complex. They are the first visualization of these cells ever reported in mice. Experiments were conducted in vivo in wildtype C57BL76 adult animals and have a low (<5%) success rate. Accurate labeling analysis is extremely labor-intensive, especially for large and widespread-axon cells. The present dataset may thus be viewed as a collection of “archetypal” reference specimens of these neuron populations. The accurate 3D data and measurement of axonal arborizations of thalamocortical neurons provide in this dataset will be re-usable by any scientist developing biologically-based models of local and long range brain circuitry.  \n**Embargo status:**\n*This dataset is temporarily under embargo.

      "description": "This dataset contains functional magnetic resonance images (fMRIs) of 12 subjects performing HCP Emotional task aiming to capture neural activity related to the perception of fear and anger. Affective facial expressions were used as visual stimuli due to their importance in adaptive social behavior. The paradigm included two categories of blocks, namely face and shape blocks. All blocks consisted of a series of events, in which images of faces or shapes were displayed, respectively. There were always three faces/shapes per image; one face/shape was shown at the top and two faces/shapes were shown at the bottom. The participants were then asked to decide which face/shape at the bottom, i.e. left or right face/shape, matched the one displayed at the top, by pressing the corresponding button of the response box. The task was formed by twelve blocks per run, i.e. six face blocks and six shape blocks. The two block categories were alternately presented for each run. All blocks contained six trials and they were always initiated by a cue of three seconds. In turn, the trials included a visual-stimulus period of two seconds and a fixation-cross period of one second; the total duration of the trial was thus three seconds.\n\n[https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/)\n\n[https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/](https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/)",

      "description": "The 3D fibre orientation model of a Wistar rat brain was derived from 3D-Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) as described in Axer et al. (2011a). \\r\\nThe Wistar rat brain was immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After cryoprotection (20% glycerin), the brain was deep frozen at -70¬∞C and stored till further processing. The brain was serially sectioned in the coronal plane (section thickness 60 ¬µm) using a large-scale cryostat microtome (Polycut CM 3500, Leica, Germany) and coverslipped with glycerin. Immediately after coverslipping, the sections were measured using the large-area polarimeter (LAP, pixel size: 64 ¬µm x 64 ¬µm, cf. Axer, 2011a). During sectioning, each blockface was digitized using a CCD camera mounted above the brain in order to obtain an undistorted reference image of each section. No staining was applied. This procedure resulted in an uninterrupted series of sections through the entire brain, which ultimately enabled the 3D reconstruction.\\r\\nThe application of the Jones calculus [Jones, 1941] describes the light transmittance through the LAP and enables the calculation of the individual spatial fiber orientation in each voxel (defined by pixel size and section thickness). The fiber orientation is defined by the pair of angles (Œ±, œï) = (inclination, direction) indicating the fiber axis orientation out of and within the section plane, respectively. Inclination and direction angles are encoded in HSV color space to provide one fiber orientation map (FOM) per section. The entire data set of aligned FOMs (i.e. the fibre orientation model) is assembled in a single NIfTI file (http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov).\\r\\n3D reconstruction of the FOMs was done in a sequential application of affine and b-spline based image alignment steps with the reconstructed blockface volume acting as reference brain. Afterwards the fibre orientation model was transferred into the common rodent reference space, the Waxholm Space atlas [Papp et al., 2014]. The transformation of the brains into the same space was done in two steps: (i) a 3D affine registration ensured the correct spatial alignment of the brains and (ii) a subsequent 3D non-linear registration compensated non-linear distortions of the brain sections.\\r\\nThe fibre orientation model of the rat brain is not part of the proposed deliverables, but it is of utmost relevance for cross-SPs data integration and platform developments.\\r\\nThe application of polarization microscopy to unstained sections of brain tissue has been extensively described in peer-reviewed publications (e.g., Axer et al. 2011a,b, Larsen et al. 2007, Wiese et al. 2014). The 3D reconstruction of histological sections based on a blockface reference has been demonstrated by Palm et al. (2010). The Waxholm Space atlas [Papp et al. (2014)] defines the reference space for rodents in the HBP and it consists of high resolution, contrast enhanced structural (including T2 and T2*-weighted) and diffusion weighted MR images with 39 Œºm isotropic voxels for the MRI volume and 78 Œºm isotropic voxels for the DTI volume. In total 79 major anatomical structures were delineated based on the architectural details in both gray and white matter, demonstrated by the structural images.\\r\\nThe dataset comprises the following files:\\r\\n1.\\tR2022_reco_blockface.nii: reconstructed blockface volume\\r\\n2.\\tR2022_reco_foms.nii: reconstructed fiber orientation maps\\r\\n3.\\tWHS_MRI_toR2022.nii: WHS MRI volume aligned to R2022_reco_blockface.nii\\r\\n4.\\tWHS_atlas_toR2022.nii: WHS atlas template aligned to R2022_reco_blockface.nii",

Physiol Rev 86:1033-1048*). Thus, positively correlated pre- and postsynaptic spiking (pre before post) within a critical window leads to long term potentiation (LTP), whereas a negative correlation (post before pre) leads to long term depression (LTD).  \nAt the neonatal stage, the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 is GABAergic and exhibits STDP. Our data demonstrate that, at the same age, positive pairing fails to induce STD-LTP at MF-CA3 synapses in hippocampal slices obtained from neuroligin-3 (NL3) knock-in (NL3<sup>R451C</sup>KI) and NL3 knock-out (KO) mice. Similarly, in NLR<sup>R451C</sup> KI mice, negative pairing failed to cause STD-LTD. In contrast, STD-LTP and STD-LTD can be readily produced in control age-matched WT littermates.

The paradigm was arranged in blocks that comprised sets of trials. Two categories of conditions can be highlighted from the paradigm: (1) the face-task category and (2) the eye-task category. Both categories involved self-reply according to the stimulus presented at every condition. The face-task category consisted in the presentation of human faces, whereas the eye-task category was dedicated to images representing human eyes. For the face-task category, two conditions corresponded to evaluation of gender and trustworthiness of the human faces. In the eye-task category, the two homologous conditions referred to gender and emotion-expression evaluation. The task concerning emotion expression in the latter category was in accordance with a cue given immediately before the image display. Besides, there was also a baseline condition, common to both categories, showing a grayscale grid image that may be tilted or not. To achieve the intended goal of this condition, a mental assessment about the orientation of the image had to be performed. The task consisted of twelve blocks per run, and every block comprised between two and four trials. The order of trials presentation was pseudorandomized for the session, but fixed for all participants. The trials lasted about 6.3 seconds. A fixation-cross period of approximately one second was presented between blocks.\n\n[https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/)\n\n[https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/](https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/)",

      "description": "A general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments was tested with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. The data used here are obtained from coronal hippocampal slices (300 μm thick) from juvenile (P21-30) C57B16/J male mice and recorded from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons receiving input from parvalbumin positive (PV+) and cholecystokinin positive (CCK+) interneurons. The dataset contains 2130 individual events recorded from 3 different neurons (expD1-D3). The first column of each txt file contains the time in ms and the other columns contain spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pA.\nComputational modeling of brain circuits requires the definition of many parameters that are difficult to determine from experimental findings. One way to help interpret these data is to fit them using a particular kinetic model. In [1] we proposed a general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments. Starting from any given model description (mod file) in the NEURON simulation environment, the procedure exploits user-defined constraints, dependencies, and rules for the parameters of the model to fit the time course of individual spontaneous synaptic events that are recorded experimentally. A Python version is available for public use, as a Jupyter Notebook in the Collaboratory Portal of the Human Brain Project. To illustrate the potential application of the procedure, we tested its use with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. For individual spontaneous inhibitory events in hippocampal pyramidal CA1 neurons, we found that gephyrin-dependent subcellular pathways may shape synaptic events at different levels, and can be correlated with cell- or event-specific activity history and/or pathological conditions.\nFitting experimental data against a number of different models is a common way to do this (reviewed in [2]), and can help in the subsequent interpretation of the data. In general, experimental traces are fitted using specific approaches for specific purposes (e.g., [3], [4]). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no easy, user-friendly, general procedure available for this purpose, especially in computational neuroscience. Our aim was thus to identify the appropriate conceptual structure of a procedure to obtain good, reliable fits of raw experimental traces of spontaneous synaptic events. This is an important step because spontaneous synaptic events have been so far exclusively analyzed using traces obtained by averaging many events. However, as can be easily imagined, each synapse in any given neuron has its own, independent, history of activation. The most likely physiological consequence is that the variables relative to the subcellular processes underlying synaptic transmission are different for each synapse. If a researcher is interested in testing a specific kinetic scheme implemented for specific biochemical pathways, the use of individual events is the most appropriate choice, since this approach would give information on the different combinations of model parameters that are consistent with the observed events. Averaging traces will lose a lot of relevant information.\nWe therefore present here the implementation of a procedure leading to the development of a unifying optimization method for individual synaptic events. Experimental data, kinetic models of synaptic transmission, and fitting parameters and their dependencies can be user defined/provided or gathered from databases. They can be used to generate optimized groups of parameters able to represent a population of synapses, either for simulation purposes or to study the functional consequences of a particular protein or subcellular synaptic transmission pathway. \n[1] Lupascu CA, Morabito A, Merenda E, et al.

Thus, positively correlated pre- and postsynaptic spiking (pre before post) within a critical window leads to long term potentiation (LTP), whereas a negative correlation (post before pre) leads to long term depression (LTD).  \nAt the neonatal stage, the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 is GABAergic and exhibits STDP.

For some conditions, these sequences were composed by well-formed sentences. They were presented as visual stimuli, using a Rapid-Serial- Visual-Presentation (RSVP) paradigm. Concretely, there were six experimental conditions featuring the different types of stimuli: i) complex meaningful sentences, containing at least two clauses (e.g. a main and a relative clause); ii) simple meaningful sentences, with only one main clause; iii) jabberwocky, obtained from well-formed sentences whose content words were replaced by meaningless, yet pronounceable pseudowords; iv) lists of words; v) lists of pseudowords; and vi) list of non-words (aka consonantstrings). Following each sequence after a short delay, a probe (which could be a word, pseudoword or non-word) was displayed with a 50% probability of having been presented in the sequence. Participants had then to indicate, by pressing one of the two possible response buttons, whether the probe had appeared in the sentence. One session of data collection comprised six runs; each of them included sixty trials related to the six experimental conditions, i.e. ten trials corresponded to one condition. The order of the trials was pseudo-randomized within and between runs across participants, such that the same experimental condition did not occur in two immediately successive trials. A trial lasted ten seconds. It started with the display of a fixation cross for two seconds, followed by the display of a blank screen for 0.5 seconds.

      "description": "A general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments was tested with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. The data used here are obtained from coronal hippocampal slices (300 μm thick) from 3 to 4 months old Tg2576 (carrying the Amyloid Precursor Protein KM670/671NL Swedish mutation) female mice. The dataset contains 1000 individual events recorded from 10 different neurons (expE1-E10). The first column of each txt file contains the time in ms and the other columns contain spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pA.\nComputational modeling of brain circuits requires the definition of many parameters that are difficult to determine from experimental findings. One way to help interpret these data is to fit them using a particular kinetic model. In [1] we proposed a general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments. Starting from any given model description (mod file) in the NEURON simulation environment, the procedure exploits user-defined constraints, dependencies, and rules for the parameters of the model to fit the time course of individual spontaneous synaptic events that are recorded experimentally. A Python version is available for public use, as a Jupyter Notebook in the Collaboratory Portal of the Human Brain Project. To illustrate the potential application of the procedure, we tested its use with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. For individual spontaneous inhibitory events in hippocampal pyramidal CA1 neurons, we found that gephyrin-dependent subcellular pathways may shape synaptic events at different levels, and can be correlated with cell- or event-specific activity history and/or pathological conditions.\nFitting experimental data against a number of different models is a common way to do this (reviewed in [2]), and can help in the subsequent interpretation of the data. In general, experimental traces are fitted using specific approaches for specific purposes (e.g., [3], [4]). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no easy, user-friendly, general procedure available for this purpose, especially in computational neuroscience. Our aim was thus to identify the appropriate conceptual structure of a procedure to obtain good, reliable fits of raw experimental traces of spontaneous synaptic events. This is an important step because spontaneous synaptic events have been so far exclusively analyzed using traces obtained by averaging many events. However, as can be easily imagined, each synapse in any given neuron has its own, independent, history of activation. The most likely physiological consequence is that the variables relative to the subcellular processes underlying synaptic transmission are different for each synapse. If a researcher is interested in testing a specific kinetic scheme implemented for specific biochemical pathways, the use of individual events is the most appropriate choice, since this approach would give information on the different combinations of model parameters that are consistent with the observed events. Averaging traces will lose a lot of relevant information.\nWe therefore present here the implementation of a procedure leading to the development of a unifying optimization method for individual synaptic events. Experimental data, kinetic models of synaptic transmission, and fitting parameters and their dependencies can be user defined/provided or gathered from databases. They can be used to generate optimized groups of parameters able to represent a population of synapses, either for simulation purposes or to study the functional consequences of a particular protein or subcellular synaptic transmission pathway.\n[1] Lupascu CA, Morabito A, Merenda E, et al.

      "description": "Spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP is a particular form of Hebbian type of learning which consists in bidirectional modifications of synaptic strength according to the temporal order of pre- and postsynaptic spiking (*Dan Y1, Poo MM (2006) Spike timing-dependent plasticity: from synapse to perception. Physiol Rev 86:1033-1048*). Thus, positively correlated pre- and postsynaptic spiking (pre before post) within a critical window leads to long term potentiation (LTP), whereas a negative correlation (post before pre) leads to long term depression (LTD).  \nAt the neonatal stage, the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 is GABAergic and exhibits STDP. Our data demonstrate that, at the same age, positive pairing fails to induce STD-LTP at MF-CA3 synapses in hippocampal slices obtained from neuroligin-3 (NL3) knock-in (NL3<sup>R451C</sup>KI) and NL3 knock-out (KO) mice. Similarly, in NLR<sup>R451C</sup> KI mice, negative pairing failed to cause STD-LTD. In contrast, STD-LTP and STD-LTD can be readily produced in control age-matched WT littermates. In NLR<sup>R451C</sup> KI  mice, the impairment in STD-LTP is maintained in adulthood when MF are glutamatergic. This set of data refers to the adult, neuroligin-3 knock-in mice, positive pairing condition.  \n\n**Embargo status:**   \n*This dataset is temporarily under embargo.

This analysis is derived from microscopic brain images taken from 12 driver-reporter constructs (DOIs for source data sets are specified in data descriptor file listed below; hbp-00170\\_Comparative\\_DataDescriptor\\_v1p1.txt) in which the different promoters regulate the expression of the E. coli derived LacZ reporter gene encoding β-galactosidase, visualized histologically using X-gal (5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside) as a substrate. Labelling was observed in microscopic images that were spatially registered to the Allen Mouse Common Coordinate Framework (v2; mouse.brain-map.org). The density of labeling was assessed by two independent researchers using a semi-quantitative grading system from 0 – 4, introduced in Yetman et al., Brain Struct Funct 221:2231-49, 2016. Here grade 0 represents absence of labeled cells (less than 1 per 0.01 mm2), grade 1 - low density (few cells, possible to count), grade 2 - medium density (several cells that can be individually discerned, but not readily counted), grade 3 - high density (many labeled cells with large degree of overlap), and grade 4 - very high density (where individual cells cannot be discerned). For each promoter-tTA line one representative case was semi-quantitatively scored and results verified in the other cases. Scores did not vary more than 1 grade between cases or researchers in any regions. The highest numbers were reported. If the density of labeling was found to vary substantially within a region, the highest observed score was recorded.",

Methodological details are provided in Odeh et al., Neuroimage 54:2603-11, 2011.

      "description": "This dataset contains functional magnetic resonance images (fMRIs) of 12 subjects performing HCP Relational task that employed a relational match-to-sample paradigm, featuring a second-order comparison of relations between two pairs of objects. It served primarily as a localizer of the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, since relational matching mechanisms have been shown to yield activity in this region. Similar to some previous tasks, the paradigm included two categories of blocks, namely relational-processing and control-matching blocks. All blocks were constituted by a set of events. In the relational-processing block, visual stimuli consisted of images representing two pairs of objects, in which one pair was placed at the top and the other one at the bottom of the image, respectively. Objects within a pair may differ in two features: shape and texture. The participants had to identify whether the pair of objects from the top differed in a specific feature and, subsequently, they were asked to determine whether the pair from the bottom changed along the same feature. For the control block, one pair of objects was displayed at the top of the image and a single object at the bottom of the same image. In addition, a cue was shown in the middle of that image, indicating which feature is relevant. The participants had thus to indicate whether the object from the bottom was matching either of the two objects from the top, according to the feature specified as a cue. This task included twelve blocks per run, with six blocks per category. Block categories were, in turn, interleaved for display within a run. A fixation-cross period of sixteen seconds was inserted between some blocks. All blocks contained six trials and they were always initiated by a cue of two seconds. The trials were described by a visual-stimulus plus response period followed by a fixation-cross period, lasting up to ten seconds. The duration of the former was nine seconds and 7.6 seconds during the relational-processing block and controlmatching block, respectively.\n\n[https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/)\n\n[https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/](https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/)",

Auditory stimuli were drawn from a recorded male voice (i.e., a total of 1.6s for motor instructions, 1.2-1.7s for sentences, and 1.2-1.3s for subtraction). The auditory or visual stimuli were shown to the participants for passive viewing or button response in event-related paradigms. Post-scan questions verified that the experimental tasks were understood and followed correctly. \nWhole-brain EPI data were acquired with the same Siemens Trio with a 32 channel head coil (TR=2400ms, TE=30ms, flip angle=60°, in-plane FOV= 19.2 * 19.2 cm, 40 slices, 3.0mm isotropic voxels). A posterior-anterior phase encoding scheme was used for all images. Standard preprocessing was performed with SPM, including slice timing, motion correction, alignment, and spatial normalization.",

      "description": "The aim of this task is to develop a protocol and a set-up for recording EEG signal from a large number of cortical areas in head-restrained rats exposed to anesthesia and during wakefulness. In order to quantify cortical complexity and its relation to (un)consciousness, a large scale EEG that samples activity from most of cortical areas is needed (Massimini et al. Science, 2005; Casali et al. Sci Transl Med, 2013). Unfortunately, only few existing probes allow this large scale recording in rodents (Megévand et al. Neuroimage, 2008; Choi et al. J Neurophysiol, 2010). Besides, since those probes are designed to be laid down on the skull surface, the obtained scalp EEG is subjected to the filtering action of the skull tissue, which separates the brain surface from the electrode. This would reduce the amplitude and the high frequency resolution of the cortical signal (Buzsàki et al. Nat Rev Neuroscience, 2012). Alternatively, epidural screw electrodes, by directly contacting the outer surface of the dura mater, showed a high signal amplitude and resolution, even for high frequencies (Arena et al. J Physiol, 2016). Therefore, we expanded the spatial density of epidural electrodes and optimized a protocol for the surgical implantation of a chronic array of 17 stainless steel electrodes by covering most of the cortical areas of a rat brain. Then, in combination with protocol for head restraining (Moore et al. Nat Protocols, 2014), we obtained multi-channel spontaneous EEG recordings from rats during wakefulness and during the exposure to low and high doses of 3 different anesthetics (propofol, sevoflurane and ketamine).   \n\n**Embargo status:**   \n*This dataset is temporarily under embargo.

      "name": "Spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons of adult wild type \nB6/SJL  mice",
      "description": "A general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments was tested with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. The data used here are obtained from coronal hippocampal slices (300 μm thick) from 3-4 months old wt (B6/SJL) female mice. The dataset contains 701 individual events recorded from 7 different neurons (expB1-B7).\nThe first column of each txt file contains the time in ms and the other columns contain spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pA.\nComputational modeling of brain circuits requires the definition of many parameters that are difficult to determine from experimental findings. One way to help interpret these data is to fit them using a particular kinetic model. In [1] we proposed a general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments. Starting from any given model description (mod file) in the NEURON simulation environment, the procedure exploits user-defined constraints, dependencies, and rules for the parameters of the model to fit the time course of individual spontaneous synaptic events that are recorded experimentally. A Python version is available for public use, as a Jupyter Notebook in the Collaboratory Portal of the Human Brain Project. To illustrate the potential application of the procedure, we tested its use with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. For individual spontaneous inhibitory events in hippocampal pyramidal CA1 neurons, we found that gephyrin-dependent subcellular pathways may shape synaptic events at different levels, and can be correlated with cell- or event-specific activity history and/or pathological conditions.\nFitting experimental data against a number of different models is a common way to do this (reviewed in [2]), and can help in the subsequent interpretation of the data. In general, experimental traces are fitted using specific approaches for specific purposes (e.g., [3], [4]). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no easy, user-friendly, general procedure available for this purpose, especially in computational neuroscience. Our aim was thus to identify the appropriate conceptual structure of a procedure to obtain good, reliable fits of raw experimental traces of spontaneous synaptic events. This is an important step because spontaneous synaptic events have been so far exclusively analyzed using traces obtained by averaging many events. However, as can be easily imagined, each synapse in any given neuron has its own, independent, history of activation. The most likely physiological consequence is that the variables relative to the subcellular processes underlying synaptic transmission are different for each synapse. If a researcher is interested in testing a specific kinetic scheme implemented for specific biochemical pathways, the use of individual events is the most appropriate choice, since this approach would give information on the different combinations of model parameters that are consistent with the observed events. Averaging traces will lose a lot of relevant information.\nWe therefore present here the implementation of a procedure leading to the development of a unifying optimization method for individual synaptic events. Experimental data, kinetic models of synaptic transmission, and fitting parameters and their dependencies can be user defined/provided or gathered from databases. They can be used to generate optimized groups of parameters able to represent a population of synapses, either for simulation purposes or to study the functional consequences of a particular protein or subcellular synaptic transmission pathway.\n[1] Lupascu CA, Morabito A, Merenda E, et al.

It was adapted from a study dedicated to exploring the particular role of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) on semantic integration. The paradigm comprised two categories of blocks: (1) story blocks and (2) math blocks. Math blocks served as a control condition in this context, since it is likely to involve both auditory processing and attentional demands. Both type of blocks exhibited auditory stimuli in short epochs, which in turn finished with a final question followed by two possible answers. During story blocks, in which participants were presented with Aesop’s fables, the final question targeted the topic of the story. Conversely, math blocks showed arithmetic problems for which the correct solution must be selected. The response was provided after the two possible options were displayed, through pressing the corresponding button of the response box. The difficulty levels of the problems, presented for both categories, were adjusted throughout the experiment, in order to keep the participants engaged in the task and, thus, ensure accurate performances. The task was composed by eleven blocks per run. For the first run, six story blocks and five math blocks were interleaved, respectively. The reverse amount and order of blocks were used during the second run. The number of trials per block varied between one and four. Nevertheless, it was assured that both block categories matched their length of presentation at every run. There was a cue during two seconds at the beginning of each block, indicating its category. The duration of the trials within a block varied from ten to thirty seconds. Finally, the presentation of the auditory stimuli was always accompanied by the display of a fixation cross on the screen throughout the entire run.\n\n[https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/)\n\n[https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/](https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/)",
