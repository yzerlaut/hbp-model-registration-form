      "description": "This dataset contains functional magnetic resonance images (fMRIs) of 12 subjects performing HCP Language task that was used as a localizer of brain regions involved in semantic processing. It was adapted from a study dedicated to exploring the particular role of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) on semantic integration. The paradigm comprised two categories of blocks: (1) story blocks and (2) math blocks. Math blocks served as a control condition in this context, since it is likely to involve both auditory processing and attentional demands. Both type of blocks exhibited auditory stimuli in short epochs, which in turn finished with a final question followed by two possible answers. During story blocks, in which participants were presented with Aesop’s fables, the final question targeted the topic of the story. Conversely, math blocks showed arithmetic problems for which the correct solution must be selected. The response was provided after the two possible options were displayed, through pressing the corresponding button of the response box. The difficulty levels of the problems, presented for both categories, were adjusted throughout the experiment, in order to keep the participants engaged in the task and, thus, ensure accurate performances. The task was composed by eleven blocks per run. For the first run, six story blocks and five math blocks were interleaved, respectively. The reverse amount and order of blocks were used during the second run. The number of trials per block varied between one and four. Nevertheless, it was assured that both block categories matched their length of presentation at every run. There was a cue during two seconds at the beginning of each block, indicating its category. The duration of the trials within a block varied from ten to thirty seconds. Finally, the presentation of the auditory stimuli was always accompanied by the display of a fixation cross on the screen throughout the entire run.\n\n[https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/)\n\n[https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/](https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/)",

      "description": "This data set is from the mental imagery and illusory perception project, currently pre-published on bioRxiv under the title “Two distinct feedback codes in V1 for ‘real’ and ‘imaginary’ internal experiences”, see [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/06/13/664870.full.pdf.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/06/13/664870.full.pdf. ) \nIt contains fMRI data from 18 subjects.  2 of these data sets were discarded prior to analysis (due to functional inter-run alignment issues).\nSummary as published on bioRxiv:\nVisual illusions and visual imagery are conscious sensory events that lack a corresponding physical input. But while everyday mental imagery feels distinct from incoming stimulus input, visual illusions, like hallucinations, are under limited volitional control and appear indistinguishable from physical reality. Illusions are thought to arise from lower-level processes within sensory cortices. In contrast, imagery involves a wide network of brain areas that recruit early visual cortices for the sensory representation of the imagined stimulus. Here, we combine laminar fMRI brain imaging with psychophysical methods and multivariate pattern analysis to investigate in human participants how seemingly ‘real’ and imaginary non-physical experiences are processed in primary visual cortex (V1). We find that the content of mental imagery is only decodable in deep layers, whereas illusory content is only decodable at superficial depths. This suggests that feedback to the different layers may serve distinct functions: low-level feedback to superficial layers might be responsible for shaping perception-like experiences, while deep-layer feedback might serve the formation of a more malleable ‘inner’ world, separate from ongoing perception.",

We, therefore, stimulated M2 of head-restrained awake rats with current pulses of different intensities, in order to approximate a stimulus-response function. We repeated these measures during general anaesthesia to verify if differences in the ERPs could be trivially explained by reduced brain excitability induced by the anaesthetic compound. We then explored the extension of the brain areas that are recruited in the response by simultaneously recording from several cortical regions and from the hippocampus, by mean of chronically implanted stainless-steel and tungsten electrodes respectively.\n\n**Embargo status:** \n*This dataset is temporarily under embargo.

Affective facial expressions were used as visual stimuli due to their importance in adaptive social behavior. The paradigm included two categories of blocks, namely face and shape blocks. All blocks consisted of a series of events, in which images of faces or shapes were displayed, respectively. There were always three faces/shapes per image; one face/shape was shown at the top and two faces/shapes were shown at the bottom. The participants were then asked to decide which face/shape at the bottom, i.e. left or right face/shape, matched the one displayed at the top, by pressing the corresponding button of the response box. The task was formed by twelve blocks per run, i.e. six face blocks and six shape blocks. The two block categories were alternately presented for each run. All blocks contained six trials and they were always initiated by a cue of three seconds. In turn, the trials included a visual-stimulus period of two seconds and a fixation-cross period of one second; the total duration of the trial was thus three seconds.\n\n[https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/)\n\n[https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/](https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/)",

Design, stimuli and computational modeling approach were identical to the ones presented to human subjects in previous experiments (Moerel et al. 2012, 2013; Santoro et al. 2017).\n\nResults: Comparative analyses revealed homologous large-scale topographies for frequency, temporal and spectral modulations. In contrast, model-based decoding of temporal modulations was most accurate for high rates (>30 Hz) in macaques, but at slower rates (~3 Hz) for humans. These slower temporal modulations are relevant for the analysis of speech sounds and may have played a role in the evolution of speech and language.",

The connectivity-based parcellation (CBP) results of this study were compared to parcellations obtained through resting-state functional connectivity and probabilistic diffusion tractography. Functional connectivity profiles and behavioral decoding of the resulting PMd subregions allowed characterizing their respective behavior profile. \n\nThese procedures divided the right PMd into five distinct subregions that formed a cognitive-motor gradient along a rostro-caudal axis:\n(i) a rostral subregion functionally connected with prefrontal cortex, which likely supports high-level cognitive processes, such as working memory \n(ii) a central subregion showing a mixed behavioral profile and functional connectivity to parietal regions of the dorsal attention network\n(iii) a caudal subregion closely integrated with the motor system\n(iv) a dorsal subregion, preferentially related to hand movements and connected to both cognitive and motor regions\n(v) a ventral subregion, whose functional profile fits the concept of an eye-movement related field. \n\nIn conclusion, right PMd may be considered as a functional mosaic formed by five subregions.\n",

Both categories involved self-reply according to the stimulus presented at every condition. The face-task category consisted in the presentation of human faces, whereas the eye-task category was dedicated to images representing human eyes. For the face-task category, two conditions corresponded to evaluation of gender and trustworthiness of the human faces. In the eye-task category, the two homologous conditions referred to gender and emotion-expression evaluation. The task concerning emotion expression in the latter category was in accordance with a cue given immediately before the image display. Besides, there was also a baseline condition, common to both categories, showing a grayscale grid image that may be tilted or not. To achieve the intended goal of this condition, a mental assessment about the orientation of the image had to be performed. The task consisted of twelve blocks per run, and every block comprised between two and four trials. The order of trials presentation was pseudorandomized for the session, but fixed for all participants. The trials lasted about 6.3 seconds.

It served primarily as a localizer of the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, since relational matching mechanisms have been shown to yield activity in this region. Similar to some previous tasks, the paradigm included two categories of blocks, namely relational-processing and control-matching blocks. All blocks were constituted by a set of events. In the relational-processing block, visual stimuli consisted of images representing two pairs of objects, in which one pair was placed at the top and the other one at the bottom of the image, respectively. Objects within a pair may differ in two features: shape and texture. The participants had to identify whether the pair of objects from the top differed in a specific feature and, subsequently, they were asked to determine whether the pair from the bottom changed along the same feature. For the control block, one pair of objects was displayed at the top of the image and a single object at the bottom of the same image. In addition, a cue was shown in the middle of that image, indicating which feature is relevant. The participants had thus to indicate whether the object from the bottom was matching either of the two objects from the top, according to the feature specified as a cue. This task included twelve blocks per run, with six blocks per category. Block categories were, in turn, interleaved for display within a run. A fixation-cross period of sixteen seconds was inserted between some blocks. All blocks contained six trials and they were always initiated by a cue of two seconds. The trials were described by a visual-stimulus plus response period followed by a fixation-cross period, lasting up to ten seconds. The duration of the former was nine seconds and 7.6 seconds during the relational-processing block and controlmatching block, respectively.\n\n[https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/)\n\n[https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/](https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/)",

      "description": "It is well established that synapses undergo activity-dependent changes in their synaptic strength. The weakening or strengthening of synapses is driven by translational and/or post-translational changes in their proteins composition, the so-called “synaptic proteome”.  Its composition is highly dynamic both in basal condition and as a result of synaptic activity. Therefore, acquisition of data on the proteomic changes underlying synaptic plasticity is crucial to properly understand the molecular mechanisms by which these organelles modify their weight according to activity. Although it is possible to obtain the proteomic profile of synaptic proteins from a bunch of different preparations (Sharma et al., 2015; Biesmann et al., 2013; Distler et al., 2014; Loh 2016) these methods do not allow to specifically detecting proteomic changes in activated synapses. Hence, with this study we aim at providing a pilot proteome dataset from hippocampal activated synapses by taking advantages of a recently developed activity-dependent synaptic expression vector . The method is based on the new expression vector pSYNACTIVE (Gobbo et al., 2017) that allows to achieve the activity dependent translation of reporter proteins at activated dendritic spines. This is possible as the pSYNACTIVE vector exploits the 5’UTR and 3’UTR RNA sequences of Arc/Arg3.1 mRNA and a PSD-targeting protein sequence fused to the report (Gobbo et al., 2017).\nThe experimental approach we propose has several advantages over the existing methods as it allows to: i) correlating protein abundance in activated synapses with the strengthening of excitatory synapses; ii) obtaining the functional mapping of activated synapses. By doing so it is possible to establish how different pattern of activity may activate different subset of excitatory synapses.\n\n**Embargo status:**   \n*This dataset is temporarily under embargo.

      "description": "This dataset contains cytoarchitectonic maps of Area hIP8 (IPS) in the Big Brain dataset [Amunts et al. 2013]. The mappings were created using the semi-automatic method presented in Schleicher et al. 1999, based on coronal histological sections on 1 micron resolution. Mappings are available on approximately every 15-60th section of this region. They were then aligned to the corresponding sections of the 3D reconstructed Big Brain space, using the transformations used in Amunts et al. 2013, kindly provided by Claude Lepage (McGill University).\n\nFrom these delineations, a preliminary 3D map of Area hIP8 (IPS) has been created by simple interpolation of the coronal contours in the 3D anatomical space of the Big Brain. This map gives a first impression of the location of this area in the Big Brain, and can be viewed in the atlas viewer using the URL below.\n\nA full mapping of this area in every histological section using a Deep Learning approach is in progress.\n\n\n**Additional information:**\nThe reference delineations used for this map are part of the work for the corresponding probabilistic map of Area hIP8 (IPS) of the JuBrain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas, published in:\nRichter et al.

The datasets contain the continuous measure of extracellular potentials at each electrode sampled at 30 kHz, the local field potentials sampled at 1 kHz and the timing of the online and offline extracted spike times. It also includes the timing of several task-related and behavioral events recorded along with the electrophysiological data. Finally, the datasets provide a complete set of metadata structured in a standardized format. These metadata allow easy access to detailed information about the datasets such as the settings of the recording hardware, the array specifications, the location of the implant in the motor cortex, information about the monkeys, or the offline spike sorting. The two datasets can be exploited to address crucial issues in neurophysiology such as: What are the principles of neural interactions in a local cortical network and how are these interactions modulated during a well-described behavioral task? How different neuronal signals such as single-unit activity, multi-unit activity or LFPs relate to each other? Which spike sorting methods provide the best estimate of single unit activity?

      "description": "The aim of this task is to develop a protocol and a set-up for recording EEG signal from a large number of cortical areas in head-restrained rats exposed to anesthesia and during wakefulness. In order to quantify cortical complexity and its relation to (un)consciousness, a large scale EEG that samples activity from most of cortical areas is needed (Massimini et al. Science, 2005; Casali et al. Sci Transl Med, 2013). Unfortunately, only few existing probes allow this large scale recording in rodents (Megévand et al. Neuroimage, 2008; Choi et al. J Neurophysiol, 2010). Besides, since those probes are designed to be laid down on the skull surface, the obtained scalp EEG is subjected to the filtering action of the skull tissue, which separates the brain surface from the electrode. This would reduce the amplitude and the high frequency resolution of the cortical signal (Buzsàki et al. Nat Rev Neuroscience, 2012). Alternatively, epidural screw electrodes, by directly contacting the outer surface of the dura mater, showed a high signal amplitude and resolution, even for high frequencies (Arena et al. J Physiol, 2016). Therefore, we expanded the spatial density of epidural electrodes and optimized a protocol for the surgical implantation of a chronic array of 17 stainless steel electrodes by covering most of the cortical areas of a rat brain. Then, in combination with protocol for head restraining (Moore et al. Nat Protocols, 2014), we obtained multi-channel spontaneous EEG recordings from rats during wakefulness and during the exposure to low and high doses of 3 different anesthetics (propofol, sevoflurane and ketamine).   \n\n**Embargo status:**   \n*This dataset is temporarily under embargo.

Its aim was to localize brain structures of the reward system, namely the basal ganglia complex. The paradigm included eight blocks and each block was composed of eight events. For every event, the participants were asked to play a game. The goal was to guess whether the next number to be displayed, which ranged from one to nine, would be smaller or larger than five while a question mark was shown on the screen. The answer was given by pressing the respective button of the response box. Feedback on the correct number was provided afterwards. There was an equal amount of blocks; the participants experienced a majority of either reward or loss events in each of them. The task was constituted by eight blocks per run, in which each half related to reward and loss experience, respectively. The order of the two block cate gories was pseudo-randomized during a single run, but fixed for all participants. A fixation-cross period of fifteen seconds was displayed between blocks. All blocks contained eight trials. The trials included a question-mark visual stimulus lasting up to 1.5 seconds, a feedback period of one second and a fixation-cross period of one second, as well; the total duration of the trial was then 3.5 seconds approximately.\n\n[https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/)\n\n[https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/](https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/)",

      "description": "A general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments was tested with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. The data used here are obtained from coronal hippocampal slices (300 μm thick) from 3-4 months old wt (B6/SJL) female mice. The dataset contains 701 individual events recorded from 7 different neurons (expB1-B7).\nThe first column of each txt file contains the time in ms and the other columns contain spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pA.\nComputational modeling of brain circuits requires the definition of many parameters that are difficult to determine from experimental findings. One way to help interpret these data is to fit them using a particular kinetic model. In [1] we proposed a general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments. Starting from any given model description (mod file) in the NEURON simulation environment, the procedure exploits user-defined constraints, dependencies, and rules for the parameters of the model to fit the time course of individual spontaneous synaptic events that are recorded experimentally. A Python version is available for public use, as a Jupyter Notebook in the Collaboratory Portal of the Human Brain Project. To illustrate the potential application of the procedure, we tested its use with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. For individual spontaneous inhibitory events in hippocampal pyramidal CA1 neurons, we found that gephyrin-dependent subcellular pathways may shape synaptic events at different levels, and can be correlated with cell- or event-specific activity history and/or pathological conditions.\nFitting experimental data against a number of different models is a common way to do this (reviewed in [2]), and can help in the subsequent interpretation of the data. In general, experimental traces are fitted using specific approaches for specific purposes (e.g., [3], [4]). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no easy, user-friendly, general procedure available for this purpose, especially in computational neuroscience. Our aim was thus to identify the appropriate conceptual structure of a procedure to obtain good, reliable fits of raw experimental traces of spontaneous synaptic events. This is an important step because spontaneous synaptic events have been so far exclusively analyzed using traces obtained by averaging many events. However, as can be easily imagined, each synapse in any given neuron has its own, independent, history of activation. The most likely physiological consequence is that the variables relative to the subcellular processes underlying synaptic transmission are different for each synapse. If a researcher is interested in testing a specific kinetic scheme implemented for specific biochemical pathways, the use of individual events is the most appropriate choice, since this approach would give information on the different combinations of model parameters that are consistent with the observed events. Averaging traces will lose a lot of relevant information.\nWe therefore present here the implementation of a procedure leading to the development of a unifying optimization method for individual synaptic events. Experimental data, kinetic models of synaptic transmission, and fitting parameters and their dependencies can be user defined/provided or gathered from databases. They can be used to generate optimized groups of parameters able to represent a population of synapses, either for simulation purposes or to study the functional consequences of a particular protein or subcellular synaptic transmission pathway.\n[1] Lupascu CA, Morabito A, Merenda E, et al.

      "description": "The efficiency of synaptic transmission relies on the temporally and spatially regulated expression of postsynaptic receptors localized in precise apposition to presynaptic release sites. At synapses, receptors are organized in clusters which are formed by highly regulated events, dynamically controlled by a number of proteins including scaffolds, adhesion molecules and active transport processes along the cytoskeleton (Kneussel and Loebrich, 2007).\n\nAt inhibitory synapses, GABAergic signaling controls dendritic integration, neural excitability, circuit reorganization and fine tuning of network activity. Among different players,  the tubulin-binding protein gephyrin,  plays a key role in anchoring GABAA receptors to synaptic membranes, (Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014). Moreover gephyrin is instrumental in establishing and maintaining a proper excitatory (E)/inhibitory (I) balance necessary for the correct functioning of neuronal networks (Pizzarelli and Cherubini, 2011). A disruption of the E/I balance is thought to be at the origin of several neuropsychiatric disorders including epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism (Penzes et al. 2013; Cellot and Cherubini, 2014; Nelson and Valakh, 2015).\n\nCortical neurons were infected at DIV 7 with lentivirus driving the expression of the single chain Fv fragments (scFv) intrabody against aminoacids 153-348 of gephyrin protein (scFv-geph). scFv geph was engineered without specific localization signals (scFv-gephcyto) , thus binding gephyrin at its normal subcellular location. Four days after infection (at DIV 11) miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were recorded from cortical pyramidal neurons expressing scFv-gephcyto with EGFP or EGFP alone. Miniature currents were reversibly blocked by bicuculline (10 μM) indicating that they were GABAA receptor-mediated. The mean mIPSCs frequency was 1.5 ± 0.1 Hz in control (n=35) and 1.8 ± 0.2 Hz in the presence of scFv-gephcyto (n=24). The mean mIPSCs amplitude was 53.2 ± 2.8 pA in control and 48.1 ± 3.5 pA in the presence of scFv-gephcyto. No significant differences in both frequency and amplitude were found between controls and scFV-gephcyto (p=0.37 and 0.19, respectively). These data suggest that the cytosolic targeting of gephyrin by scFv-gephcyto is not effective to alter GABAergic neurotransmission.\n\nCellot G, Cherubini E (2014) GABAergic signaling as therapeutic target for autism spectrum disorders.

      "description": "The 3D fibre orientation model of a Wistar rat brain was derived from 3D-Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) as described in Axer et al. (2011a). \\r\\nThe Wistar rat brain was immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After cryoprotection (20% glycerin), the brain was deep frozen at -70¬∞C and stored till further processing. The brain was serially sectioned in the coronal plane (section thickness 60 ¬µm) using a large-scale cryostat microtome (Polycut CM 3500, Leica, Germany) and coverslipped with glycerin. Immediately after coverslipping, the sections were measured using the large-area polarimeter (LAP, pixel size: 64 ¬µm x 64 ¬µm, cf. Axer, 2011a). During sectioning, each blockface was digitized using a CCD camera mounted above the brain in order to obtain an undistorted reference image of each section. No staining was applied. This procedure resulted in an uninterrupted series of sections through the entire brain, which ultimately enabled the 3D reconstruction.\\r\\nThe application of the Jones calculus [Jones, 1941] describes the light transmittance through the LAP and enables the calculation of the individual spatial fiber orientation in each voxel (defined by pixel size and section thickness). The fiber orientation is defined by the pair of angles (Œ±, œï) = (inclination, direction) indicating the fiber axis orientation out of and within the section plane, respectively. Inclination and direction angles are encoded in HSV color space to provide one fiber orientation map (FOM) per section. The entire data set of aligned FOMs (i.e. the fibre orientation model) is assembled in a single NIfTI file (http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov).\\r\\n3D reconstruction of the FOMs was done in a sequential application of affine and b-spline based image alignment steps with the reconstructed blockface volume acting as reference brain. Afterwards the fibre orientation model was transferred into the common rodent reference space, the Waxholm Space atlas [Papp et al., 2014]. The transformation of the brains into the same space was done in two steps: (i) a 3D affine registration ensured the correct spatial alignment of the brains and (ii) a subsequent 3D non-linear registration compensated non-linear distortions of the brain sections.\\r\\nThe fibre orientation model of the rat brain is not part of the proposed deliverables, but it is of utmost relevance for cross-SPs data integration and platform developments.\\r\\nThe application of polarization microscopy to unstained sections of brain tissue has been extensively described in peer-reviewed publications (e.g., Axer et al. 2011a,b, Larsen et al. 2007, Wiese et al. 2014). The 3D reconstruction of histological sections based on a blockface reference has been demonstrated by Palm et al. (2010). The Waxholm Space atlas [Papp et al. (2014)] defines the reference space for rodents in the HBP and it consists of high resolution, contrast enhanced structural (including T2 and T2*-weighted) and diffusion weighted MR images with 39 Œºm isotropic voxels for the MRI volume and 78 Œºm isotropic voxels for the DTI volume. In total 79 major anatomical structures were delineated based on the architectural details in both gray and white matter, demonstrated by the structural images.\\r\\nThe dataset comprises the following files:\\r\\n1.\\tR2022_reco_blockface.nii: reconstructed blockface volume\\r\\n2.\\tR2022_reco_foms.nii: reconstructed fiber orientation maps\\r\\n3.\\tWHS_MRI_toR2022.nii: WHS MRI volume aligned to R2022_reco_blockface.nii\\r\\n4.\\tWHS_atlas_toR2022.nii: WHS atlas template aligned to R2022_reco_blockface.nii",

      "description": "Complexity, defined as the coexistence of functional differentiation and functional integration is a general property of thalamo-cortical circuits that can be characterized at multiscale level. Previously, we mainly focused on the relationship between slow waves and complexity, explored by perturbations and electrophysiological recordings, from micro- to macro-scale. The final goal was to link dynamics occurring at the micro-scale, such as sleep-like neuronal bistability, to the collapse/emergence of global patterns of complex interactions among brain areas at the macroscale.\n\nAt the mesoscale level, we combined for the first time in this dataset (Pigorini et al. in prep.) intracortical single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) in humans undergoing pre-surgical evaluation, with simultaneous intracortical recordings (stereo-EEG) and high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG, 256 channels) during both wakefulness and sleep.\n\nLocal perturbations with SPES allow studying bistable dynamics (downstates in the Local Field Potential) and their effects on local cortico-cortical interactions (Pigorini et al. 2015). Adding simultaneous hd-EEG links these intracortical events to overall connectivity and complexity as assessed at the scalp level (Casali et al. 2013, Sci Tr Med).\n\nThe data is organized in two conditions (sessions): wakefulness and sleep. Subjects were patients that were undergoing intracranial monitoring for surgical planning due to refractory epilepsy. The project was approved by the corresponding Ethics Committee, all subjects provided informed consent and the experiments were carried out in accordance to the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n**References:**\n\n**Pigorini et al.

Physiol Rev 86:1033-1048*). Thus, positively correlated pre- and postsynaptic spiking (pre before post) within a critical window leads to long term potentiation (LTP), whereas a negative correlation (post before pre) leads to long term depression (LTD).  \nAt the neonatal stage, the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 is GABAergic and exhibits STDP. Our data demonstrate that, at the same age, positive pairing fails to induce STD-LTP at MF-CA3 synapses in hippocampal slices obtained from neuroligin-3 (NL3) knock-in (NL3<sup>R451C</sup>KI) and NL3 knock-out (KO) mice. Similarly, in NLR<sup>R451C</sup> KI mice, negative pairing failed to cause STD-LTD. In contrast, STD-LTP and STD-LTD can be readily produced in control age-matched WT littermates. In NLR<sup>R451C</sup> KI  mice, the impairment in STD-LTP is maintained in adulthood when MF are glutamatergic. This set of data refers to the neonate, C57BL/6 (wild-type), negative pairing condition. \n\n**Embargo status:**   \n*This dataset is temporarily under embargo.

      "description": "The efficiency of synaptic transmission relies on the temporally and spatially regulated expression of postsynaptic receptors localized in precise apposition to presynaptic release sites. At synapses, receptors are organized in clusters which are formed by highly regulated events, dynamically controlled by a number of proteins including scaffolds, adhesion molecules and active transport processes along the cytoskeleton (Kneussel and Loebrich, 2007).\n\nAt inhibitory synapses, GABAergic signaling controls dendritic integration, neural excitability, circuit reorganization and fine tuning of network activity. Among different players, the tubulin-binding protein gephyrin, plays a key role in anchoring GABAA receptors to synaptic membranes, (Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014). Moreover, gephyrin is instrumental in establishing and maintaining a proper excitatory (E)/inhibitory (I) balance necessary for the correct functioning of neuronal networks (Pizzarelli and Cherubini, 2011). A disruption of the E/I balance is thought to be at the origin of several neuropsychiatric disorders including epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism (Penzes et al. 2013; Cellot and Cherubini, 2014; Nelson and Valakh, 2015).\n\nWe tested the effects of truncated form of gephyrin (delta 2-188), acting as a dominant negative protein, on spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents, sIPSCs, from hippocampal neurons in culture.  In cells transfected with delta 2-188 fused to EGFP or with EGFP alone, the mean sIPSCs frequency was 0.91 ± 0.18 Hz in control (n=10) and 0.42 ± 0.09 Hz in the presence of delta 2-188 (n=9). The mean sIPSCs amplitude was 129.4 ± 18.8 pA in controls and 81.9 ±m13.2 pA in the presence of delta 2-188. Significant differences were found between controls and delta 2-188 regarding the frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs (p=0.03 and p=0.05, respectively). These data further support the hypothesis that gephyrin regulates the postsynaptic organization of synaptic GABAA receptors.\n \nAndjus, P R, Stevic‐Marinkovic, Z and Cherubini E (1997) Immunoglobulins from motoneurone disease patients enhance glutamate release from rat hippocampal neurones in culture.

      "description": "This dataset contains functional magnetic resonance images (fMRIs) of 12 subjects performing RSVP Language task to localize the areas implicated in language comprehension, participants were presented with stimuli consisting of sequences of words, pseudowords or nonwords. For some conditions, these sequences were composed by well-formed sentences. They were presented as visual stimuli, using a Rapid-Serial- Visual-Presentation (RSVP) paradigm. Concretely, there were six experimental conditions featuring the different types of stimuli: i) complex meaningful sentences, containing at least two clauses (e.g. a main and a relative clause); ii) simple meaningful sentences, with only one main clause; iii) jabberwocky, obtained from well-formed sentences whose content words were replaced by meaningless, yet pronounceable pseudowords; iv) lists of words; v) lists of pseudowords; and vi) list of non-words (aka consonantstrings). Following each sequence after a short delay, a probe (which could be a word, pseudoword or non-word) was displayed with a 50% probability of having been presented in the sequence. Participants had then to indicate, by pressing one of the two possible response buttons, whether the probe had appeared in the sentence. One session of data collection comprised six runs; each of them included sixty trials related to the six experimental conditions, i.e. ten trials corresponded to one condition. The order of the trials was pseudo-randomized within and between runs across participants, such that the same experimental condition did not occur in two immediately successive trials. A trial lasted ten seconds. It started with the display of a fixation cross for two seconds, followed by the display of a blank screen for 0.5 seconds. Afterwards, a sequence of ten stimuli was presented at a rate of one stimulus per 0.4 seconds. Further, a blank screen was displayed during a randomly varying period of time between one and 1.5 seconds, followed by the display of a fixation cross for 0.5 seconds plus a probe stimulus for 0.5 seconds.

      "description": "Single-unit neuronal activity were recorded from chronic bihemispheric tetrode-implants in the roaming and anesthetized rat during visual stimulation. Key dataset strength: the same units are identified and followed between states, where the majority of previous investigations compare separate populations of neurons. Ideal for modelling of the wakeful/anesthesia -relationship.\n\nWe provide a dataset of 269  single units recorded from the primary visual cortex of 12 male Long Evans rats. The units were recorded using chronic implants of 4x4 electrodes (tetrode-configuration), allowing us to monitor the same cells across states and keep the animals unrestrained. The rats were resting in a square glass enclosure surrounded by 4 close screens, covering the majority of the rats visual field. Full-screen drifting gratings of 8 orientations were presented as the visual stimulus, with an interspersed blank screen to measure spontaneous activity. Rat body position was monitored using a head-fixed infrared LED and tracked from above.  Following a wakeful experimental session the rats were  anesthetized with either Isoflurane, Ketamine/ Xylazine or Isoflurane/ Dormicum. The eyes were kept open throughout the anesthetic session, and body temperature and heartrate was continuously monitored.  The visual stimulus was kept at the spatial frequency of 0.08 cycles per degree (c/d) and temporal frequency of 4  Hertz (Hz). For a subset of units a small spectrum of temporal and spatial frequencies was compared between the states (0.3,0.16,0.08,0.04,0.02 c/d, 2,4,8 Hz). \nTODO- Specs about the dataformat and metadataformat. -Going for Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)- but not yet implemented at CINPLA - will come during the fall.  Janelia people are coming to help set it up. Could get assistance from Andrew Davidson from my end.\n\n \n(from Abstract)\nThe activity pattern and temporal dynamics within and between neuron ensembles are essential features of information processing and believed to be profoundly affected by anesthesia. Much of our general understanding of sensory information processing, including computational models aimed at mathematically simulating sensory information processing, rely on parameters derived from recordings conducted on animals under anesthesia. Due to the high variety of neuronal subtypes in the brain, population-based estimates of the impact of anesthesia may conceal unit- or ensemble-specific effects of the transition between states. Using chronically implanted tetrodes into primary visual cortex (V1) of rats, we conducted extracellular recordings of single units and followed the same cell ensembles in the awake and anesthetized states. We found that the transition from wakefulness to anesthesia involves unpredictable changes in temporal response characteristics (see appended publication). The current dataset, with recordings from the same neural ensembles across states, is well suited for validating and testing computational network models. This can lead to testable predictions, bring a deeper understanding of the experimental findings and improve models of neural information processing.",

      "description": "A general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments was tested with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. The data used here are obtained from coronal hippocampal slices (300 μm thick) from juvenile (P21-30) C57B16/J male mice receiving input from parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons. The dataset contains 614 individual events recorded from 3 different neurons (expC1-C3). The first column of each txt file contains the time in ms and the other columns contain spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pA.\nComputational modeling of brain circuits requires the definition of many parameters that are difficult to determine from experimental findings. One way to help interpret these data is to fit them using a particular kinetic model. In [1] we proposed a general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments. Starting from any given model description (mod file) in the NEURON simulation environment, the procedure exploits user-defined constraints, dependencies, and rules for the parameters of the model to fit the time course of individual spontaneous synaptic events that are recorded experimentally. A Python version is available for public use, as a Jupyter Notebook in the Collaboratory Portal of the Human Brain Project. To illustrate the potential application of the procedure, we tested its use with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. For individual spontaneous inhibitory events in hippocampal pyramidal CA1 neurons, we found that gephyrin-dependent subcellular pathways may shape synaptic events at different levels, and can be correlated with cell- or event-specific activity history and/or pathological conditions.\nFitting experimental data against a number of different models is a common way to do this (reviewed in [2]), and can help in the subsequent interpretation of the data. In general, experimental traces are fitted using specific approaches for specific purposes (e.g., [3], [4]). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no easy, user-friendly, general procedure available for this purpose, especially in computational neuroscience. Our aim was thus to identify the appropriate conceptual structure of a procedure to obtain good, reliable fits of raw experimental traces of spontaneous synaptic events. This is an important step because spontaneous synaptic events have been so far exclusively analyzed using traces obtained by averaging many events. However, as can be easily imagined, each synapse in any given neuron has its own, independent, history of activation. The most likely physiological consequence is that the variables relative to the subcellular processes underlying synaptic transmission are different for each synapse. If a researcher is interested in testing a specific kinetic scheme implemented for specific biochemical pathways, the use of individual events is the most appropriate choice, since this approach would give information on the different combinations of model parameters that are consistent with the observed events. Averaging traces will lose a lot of relevant information.\nWe therefore present here the implementation of a procedure leading to the development of a unifying optimization method for individual synaptic events. Experimental data, kinetic models of synaptic transmission, and fitting parameters and their dependencies can be user defined/provided or gathered from databases. They can be used to generate optimized groups of parameters able to represent a population of synapses, either for simulation purposes or to study the functional consequences of a particular protein or subcellular synaptic transmission pathway. \n[1] Lupascu CA, Morabito A, Merenda E, et al.

The resulting PMd modules were then characterized based on multimodal functional connectivity and a quantitative analysis of associated behavioral functions. Analyzing the clusters consistent across all modalities revealed an organization of the left PMd that mirrored its right counterpart to a large degree. Caudal, central and rostral modules reflected a cognitive-motor gradient and a premotor eye-field was found in the ventral part of the left PMd. In addition, a distinct module linked to abstract cognitive functions was observed in the rostro-ventral left PMd across all CBP modalities, implying greater differentiation of higher cognitive functions for the left than the right PMd.\n",

Mappings are available on approximately every 15-60th section of this region.

      "description": "We used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) at 7T, complemented with additional 3T data. Six healthy participants, with normal or corrected to normal vision, saw stimuli of two different object classes (presented in blocks) while performing a visual detection task. Whereas fixation was kept at the middle of the screen, stimuli were presented at peripheral locations (at 6° eccentricity in the lower visual quadrant). Crucially, a stimulus could either be presented in isolation in one hemifield (unilateral stimulation), or could be combined with a simultaneously presented stimulus in the opposite hemifield (bilateral stimulation). Focusing on the entire ensemble of visually responsive voxels in occipitotemporal cortex, we assessed to what extent object category decoding was possible based on distributed voxel activation patterns in either hemisphere both within and across hemifields, as previously shown for category-selective regions at 3T (e.g., Cichy et al., 2011, Cichy et al., 2013). Furthermore, we examined how object position and identity preferences are reflected in (rank ordered) voxel-wise response amplitudes. In addition, we quantified the consistency of the overlap in activations to uni- and bilateral stimulus configurations across subjects. Finally we explored how to optimally predict the response to bilateral stimulus configurations based on the responses to their constituent elements shown in isolation.  ",

Physiol Rev 86:1033-1048*). Thus, positively correlated pre- and postsynaptic spiking (pre before post) within a critical window leads to long term potentiation (LTP), whereas a negative correlation (post before pre) leads to long term depression (LTD).  \nAt the neonatal stage, the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 is GABAergic and exhibits STDP. Our data demonstrate that, at the same age, positive pairing fails to induce STD-LTP at MF-CA3 synapses in hippocampal slices obtained from neuroligin-3 (NL3) knock-in (NL3<sup>R451C</sup>KI) and NL3 knock-out (KO) mice. Similarly, in NLR<sup>R451C</sup> KI mice, negative pairing failed to cause STD-LTD. In contrast, STD-LTP and STD-LTD can be readily produced in control age-matched WT littermates. In NLR<sup>R451C</sup> KI  mice, the impairment in STD-LTP is maintained in adulthood when MF are glutamatergic.

      "description": "Memories of daily events usually involve multiple elements, while a single element can be sufficient to prompt recollection of the whole event. Such holistic recollection is thought to require reactivation of brain activity representing the full event from one event element (‘pattern completion’). \nA recent study implicated activity in the human hippocampus with holistic recollection of multi-element events based on cues (Horner, Bisby, Bush, Lin, & Burgess et al., 2015).  Computational and animal models suggest that mnemonic pattern completion is accomplished in a specific subregion of the hippocampus called CA3, but empirical evidence in humans was lacking. \nHere, we leverage the ultra-high resolution of 7 Tesla neuroimaging to provide first evidence for involvement of the human CA3 in holistic recollection of multi-element events via pattern completion. We used the same paradigm as Horner and colleagues (2015) during which multi-element events were learned as overlapping pairs of associations between elements (places, people and objects), and subsequently retrieved as paired associations. This task allows to assess holistic recollection both behaviorally and in terms of neural activity as well as the integration of event elements at encoding.  Fully overlapping associations (closed-loops), which appear to create coherent events can be compared with partially overlapping associations (open-loops), see Horner et al. (2015) and Grande et al. (in press) for details. In total, we obtained ultra-high resolution functional and structural (T1 and T2 contrast) neuroimaging data at 7 Tesla in 30 younger adults (12 female). \n\nHere, we curate the raw data that spans functional MRI in the medial temporal lobe, large parts of the parietal cortex as well as part of the visual cortex during the multi-element event paradigm’s learning and retrieval phase (‘general raw data’).

Even though many methods and algorithms have been proposed, their relative advantages and limitations are still not well established. Moreover, these methods involve tailoring multiple parameters, for which no principled way of selection exists yet. These uncertainties are emphasized due to the lack of ground-truth for their validation and testing. \n\nHere we provide the first open dataset that comprises EEG recorded electrical activity originating from precisely known locations inside the brain of living humans. High-density EEG was recorded during intracerebral electrical stimulation performed during pre-surgical evaluation of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Single-pulse biphasic currents were delivered at intensities ranging from 0.1 to 5 mA through stereotactically implanted electrodes in diverse regions of the brain. \n\nThe potential uses of this dataset range from the estimation of in vivo tissue conductivity to the development, validation and testing of forward and inverse solution methods.\n\n**Funding:** This project/research has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under the Specific Grant Agreement No. 785907 (Human Brain Project SGA1 & SGA2)",

      "description": "A general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments was tested with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. The data used here are obtained from coronal hippocampal slices (300 μm thick) from juvenile (P21-30) C57B16/J male mice and recorded from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons receiving input from parvalbumin positive (PV+) and cholecystokinin positive (CCK+) interneurons. The dataset contains 2130 individual events recorded from 3 different neurons (expD1-D3). The first column of each txt file contains the time in ms and the other columns contain spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pA.\nComputational modeling of brain circuits requires the definition of many parameters that are difficult to determine from experimental findings. One way to help interpret these data is to fit them using a particular kinetic model. In [1] we proposed a general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments. Starting from any given model description (mod file) in the NEURON simulation environment, the procedure exploits user-defined constraints, dependencies, and rules for the parameters of the model to fit the time course of individual spontaneous synaptic events that are recorded experimentally. A Python version is available for public use, as a Jupyter Notebook in the Collaboratory Portal of the Human Brain Project. To illustrate the potential application of the procedure, we tested its use with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. For individual spontaneous inhibitory events in hippocampal pyramidal CA1 neurons, we found that gephyrin-dependent subcellular pathways may shape synaptic events at different levels, and can be correlated with cell- or event-specific activity history and/or pathological conditions.\nFitting experimental data against a number of different models is a common way to do this (reviewed in [2]), and can help in the subsequent interpretation of the data. In general, experimental traces are fitted using specific approaches for specific purposes (e.g., [3], [4]). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no easy, user-friendly, general procedure available for this purpose, especially in computational neuroscience. Our aim was thus to identify the appropriate conceptual structure of a procedure to obtain good, reliable fits of raw experimental traces of spontaneous synaptic events. This is an important step because spontaneous synaptic events have been so far exclusively analyzed using traces obtained by averaging many events. However, as can be easily imagined, each synapse in any given neuron has its own, independent, history of activation. The most likely physiological consequence is that the variables relative to the subcellular processes underlying synaptic transmission are different for each synapse. If a researcher is interested in testing a specific kinetic scheme implemented for specific biochemical pathways, the use of individual events is the most appropriate choice, since this approach would give information on the different combinations of model parameters that are consistent with the observed events. Averaging traces will lose a lot of relevant information.\nWe therefore present here the implementation of a procedure leading to the development of a unifying optimization method for individual synaptic events. Experimental data, kinetic models of synaptic transmission, and fitting parameters and their dependencies can be user defined/provided or gathered from databases. They can be used to generate optimized groups of parameters able to represent a population of synapses, either for simulation purposes or to study the functional consequences of a particular protein or subcellular synaptic transmission pathway. \n[1] Lupascu CA, Morabito A, Merenda E, et al.

The cells in the dataset were labeled using state-of the art viral vectors able to drive massive levels of expression of marker proteins in a neuron after a single transfection event, leaving the rest of the brain unlabeled. This allows the unambiguous visualization /measurement of the entire axonal tree, no matter how large or complex. They are the first visualization of these cells ever reported in mice. Experiments were conducted in vivo in wildtype C57BL76 adult animals and have a low (<5%) success rate. Accurate labeling analysis is extremely labor-intensive, especially for large and widespread-axon cells. The present dataset may thus be viewed as a collection of “archetypal” reference specimens of these neuron populations.

      "description": "The efficiency of synaptic transmission relies on the temporally and spatially regulated expression of postsynaptic receptors localized in precise apposition to presynaptic release sites. At synapses, receptors are organized in clusters which are formed by highly regulated events, dynamically controlled by a number of proteins including scaffolds, adhesion molecules and active transport processes along the cytoskeleton (Kneussel and Loebrich, 2007).\n\nNeuroligins (NLGNs) are adhesion molecules which together with neurexins (NRXNs) provide a direct link between the pre- and the postsynaptic sites by bridging the cleft (Lisé and El-Husseini, Cell Mol Life Sci 2006). The binding between NRXNs and NLGNs represents not only a structural but also a functional link between pre- and postsynaptic elements. The bidirectional signaling through the NLGN-NRXNs pathway is crucial for synapse development and stabilization (Levinson and El-Husseini, Neuron 2005; Craig and Kang, Curr Opin Neurobiol 2007). In particular, the neuroligin type 2 (NLGN2) is preferentially associated with GABAergic synapses (Varoqueaux et al., Eur J Cell Biol 2004). By regulating signaling between pre- and postsynaptic specializations these proteins play a key role in information processing and contribute to maintain the excitatory (E) /inhibitory (I) balance. This represents a critical condition for the correct functioning of neuronal networks and requires precise connections through dynamic processes involving neurotransmitter receptors, transporters, scaffolding proteins and the cytoskeleton. In physiological conditions the E/I balance is kept constant by a homeostatic feedback mechanism (Turrigiano and Nelson, Nat Rev Neurosci 2004). An incorrect E/I balance at the level of cortical microcircuits may underlie several forms of neuropsychiatric disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorders, Schizophrenia and Depression (Nelson SB and Valakh V, Neuron 2015). \n\nIn cortical cultures, action potential independent spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (miniature IPSCs) were recorded from pyramidal neurons infected with a lentivirus vector driving the expression of EGFP or EGFP fused with the intrabody against the cytoplasmic domain of NLG2 (scFvNLG2-645). This intrabody is made against NLG2 complete cytoplasmatic domain containing both gephyrin binding and collybistin binding domains. The scFvNLG2-645 significantly impaired inhibitory neurotransmission, altering the frequency of GABAergic postsynaptic currents. These data support the hypothesis that NLG2 regulates the presynaptic organization of GABAergic synapses.\n\n\nCraig AM1, Kang Y (2007) Neurexin-neuroligin signaling in synapse development.

At synapses, receptors are organized in clusters which are formed by highly regulated events, dynamically controlled by a number of proteins including scaffolds, adhesion molecules and active transport processes along the cytoskeleton (Kneussel and Loebrich, 2007).\n\nAt inhibitory synapses, GABAergic signaling controls dendritic integration, neural excitability, circuit reorganization and fine tuning of network activity. Among different players,  the tubulin-binding protein gephyrin plays a key role in anchoring GABAA receptors to synaptic membranes (Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014). Moreover, gephyrin is instrumental in establishing and maintaining a proper excitatory (E)/inhibitory (I) balance necessary for the correct functioning of neuronal networks (Pizzarelli and Cherubini, 2011). A disruption of the E/I balance is thought to be at the origin of several neuropsychiatric disorders including epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism (Penzes et al. 2013; Cellot and Cherubini, 2014; Nelson and Valakh, 2015). \n\nCortical neurons were infected at DIV 7 with lentivirus driving the expression of the single chain Fv fragments (scFv) intrabody against aminoacids 153-348 of gephyrin protein (scFv-geph) fused with a specific nuclear localization signal (scFv-geph NLSC). Four days after infection (at DIV 11) miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were recorded from cortical pyramidal neurons expressing EGFP. Miniature currents were reversibly blocked by bicuculline (10 μM) indicating that they were GABAA receptor-mediated. The mean mIPSCs frequency was 1.5 ± 0.1 Hz in control (n=35) and 1.1 ± 0.1 Hz in the presence of scFV-geph NLSC (n=20). The mean mIPSCs amplitude was 53.2 ± 2.8 pA in control and 37.9 ± 1.7 pA in the presence of scFv-geph NLSC. Significant differences were found between controls and scFv-geph NLSC in amplitude and frequency (p=0.037 and 0.00028, respectively). These results suggest that scFv-geph NLSC (which removes gephyrin from the synapses, retargeting it away into the nucleus) significantly impaired inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission.\n\nCellot G, Cherubini E (2014) GABAergic signaling as therapeutic target for autism spectrum disorders.

Auditory stimuli were drawn from a recorded male voice (i.e., a total of 1.6s for motor instructions, 1.2-1.7s for sentences, and 1.2-1.3s for subtraction). The auditory or visual stimuli were shown to the participants for passive viewing or button response in event-related paradigms. Post-scan questions verified that the experimental tasks were understood and followed correctly. \nWhole-brain EPI data were acquired with the same Siemens Trio with a 32 channel head coil (TR=2400ms, TE=30ms, flip angle=60°, in-plane FOV= 19.2 * 19.2 cm, 40 slices, 3.0mm isotropic voxels).

Mappings are available on every section. Their quality was observed by a trained neuroscientist to exclude sections with low quality results from further processing. Automatic mappings were then transformed to the 3D reconstructed BigBrain space using transformations used in Amunts et al. 2013, which were provided by Claude Lepage (McGill). Individual sections were used to assemble a 3D volume of the area, low quality results were replaced by interpolations between nearest neighboring sections. The volume was then smoothed using an 11³ median filter and largest connected components were identified to remove false positive results of the classification algorithm.\nThe dataset consists of a single HDF5 file containing the volume in RAS dimension ordering and 20 micron isotropic resolution in the dataset “volume” and affine transformation matrix in the dataset “affine”. An additional dataset “interpolation_info” contains a vector with an integer value for each section which indicates if a section was interpolated due to low quality results (value 2) or not (value 1).\nDue to the large size of the volume, it’s recommended to view the data online using the provided viewer link.\n",

Physiol Rev 86:1033-1048*). Thus, positively correlated pre- and postsynaptic spiking (pre before post) within a critical window leads to long term potentiation (LTP), whereas a negative correlation (post before pre) leads to long term depression (LTD).  \nAt the neonatal stage, the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 is GABAergic and exhibits STDP. Our data demonstrate that, at the same age, positive pairing fails to induce STD-LTP at MF-CA3 synapses in hippocampal slices obtained from neuroligin-3 (NL3) knock-in (NL3<sup>R451C</sup>KI) and NL3 knock-out (KO) mice. Similarly, in NLR<sup>R451C</sup> KI mice, negative pairing failed to cause STD-LTD. In contrast, STD-LTP and STD-LTD can be readily produced in control age-matched WT littermates. In NLR<sup>R451C</sup> KI  mice, the impairment in STD-LTP is maintained in adulthood when MF are glutamatergic.

These cortical profiles were segmented into layers using a convolutional neural network. Training profiles were generated from examples of manually segmented layers on cortical regions from 2D histological sections of the BigBrain. From the segmented intensity profiles, surface meshes and voxel masks of all six cortical layers in the space of the Big Brain have been computed.\n\nIn Wagstyl et al.

      "description": "Aim of project: To assign coordinates and quantify parvalbumin positive cells extracted from a series of brain section images obtained from the Allen Brain ISH repository. \n\nStudy design: The image series was exported from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas Data Portal, http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/75457579 (© 2004 Allen Institute for Brain Science. Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. Available from: mouse.brain-map.org). The series included images of 20 sagittal mouse brain sections from the left hemisphere labelled for parvalbumin by in situ hybridisation (Specimen 06-0419, Probe RP_060523_03_E07; Image credit: Allen Institute). Positive cells were identified by segmentation with the ilastik software. The section images were registered to reference atlas space with the QuickNII software and custom atlas maps were exported. Extracted features were quantified, localised and assigned coordinates with the Nutil software. \n\nStudy output: \n20 segmentation images \n20 customised atlas maps\n20 atlas maps with superimposed colour coded features\nA .json file with coordinates for visualising the  parvalbumin positive cells in atlas space (Allen mouse brain Common Coordinate framework version 3).\n2 reports (.docx) with quantifications per atlas region (1 report is for the whole brain, the other per section). \n\nReference: \nAllen Mouse Brain Atlas.

Events of block categories 4 and 5 featured the same visual stimuli. The task was constituted by forty blocks per run.

      "description": "A general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments was tested with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. The data used here are obtained from coronal hippocampal slices (300 μm thick) from 3 to 4 months old Tg2576 (carrying the Amyloid Precursor Protein KM670/671NL Swedish mutation) female mice. The dataset contains 1000 individual events recorded from 10 different neurons (expE1-E10). The first column of each txt file contains the time in ms and the other columns contain spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pA.\nComputational modeling of brain circuits requires the definition of many parameters that are difficult to determine from experimental findings. One way to help interpret these data is to fit them using a particular kinetic model. In [1] we proposed a general procedure to fit individual synaptic events recorded from voltage clamp experiments. Starting from any given model description (mod file) in the NEURON simulation environment, the procedure exploits user-defined constraints, dependencies, and rules for the parameters of the model to fit the time course of individual spontaneous synaptic events that are recorded experimentally. A Python version is available for public use, as a Jupyter Notebook in the Collaboratory Portal of the Human Brain Project. To illustrate the potential application of the procedure, we tested its use with various sets of experimental data on GABAergic synapses; gephyrin and gephyrin-dependent pathways were chosen as a suitable example of a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. For individual spontaneous inhibitory events in hippocampal pyramidal CA1 neurons, we found that gephyrin-dependent subcellular pathways may shape synaptic events at different levels, and can be correlated with cell- or event-specific activity history and/or pathological conditions.\nFitting experimental data against a number of different models is a common way to do this (reviewed in [2]), and can help in the subsequent interpretation of the data. In general, experimental traces are fitted using specific approaches for specific purposes (e.g., [3], [4]). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no easy, user-friendly, general procedure available for this purpose, especially in computational neuroscience. Our aim was thus to identify the appropriate conceptual structure of a procedure to obtain good, reliable fits of raw experimental traces of spontaneous synaptic events. This is an important step because spontaneous synaptic events have been so far exclusively analyzed using traces obtained by averaging many events. However, as can be easily imagined, each synapse in any given neuron has its own, independent, history of activation. The most likely physiological consequence is that the variables relative to the subcellular processes underlying synaptic transmission are different for each synapse. If a researcher is interested in testing a specific kinetic scheme implemented for specific biochemical pathways, the use of individual events is the most appropriate choice, since this approach would give information on the different combinations of model parameters that are consistent with the observed events. Averaging traces will lose a lot of relevant information.\nWe therefore present here the implementation of a procedure leading to the development of a unifying optimization method for individual synaptic events. Experimental data, kinetic models of synaptic transmission, and fitting parameters and their dependencies can be user defined/provided or gathered from databases. They can be used to generate optimized groups of parameters able to represent a population of synapses, either for simulation purposes or to study the functional consequences of a particular protein or subcellular synaptic transmission pathway.\n[1] Lupascu CA, Morabito A, Merenda E, et al.

The paradigm included two categories of blocks, namely the “0-back” and “2- back” WM-task blocks. They were both equally presented within a run. A cue was always displayed at the beginning of each block, indicating its block type. Blocks were formed by sets of events, during which pictures of faces, places, tools or body parts were shown on the screen. One block was always dedicated to one specific category of pictures and the four categories were always presented during every run. The task was constituted by sixteen blocks per run, eight per n-back category. Besides, there were four pairs of blocks per visual category. The order of the blocks, regardless of their category and corresponding class of pictures, was pseudo-randomized for every run, but fixed for all participants. A fixationcross period of fifteen seconds was introduced between some blocks. All blocks contained ten trials; they were initiated by a cue during 2.5 seconds. Trials included in turn the presentation of a picture for two seconds and a very short fixation-cross period for half of a second; the total duration of one trial was thus 2.5 seconds.\n\n[https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000244/)\n\n[https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/](https://neurovault.org/collections/2138/)",

Among different players, the tubulin-binding protein gephyrin, plays a key role in anchoring GABAA receptors to synaptic membranes (Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014). Moreover, gephyrin is instrumental in establishing and maintaining a proper excitatory (E)/inhibitory (I) balance necessary for the correct functioning of neuronal networks (Pizzarelli and Cherubini, 2011). A disruption of the E/I balance is thought to be at the origin of several neuropsychiatric disorders including epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism (Penzes et al. 2013; Cellot and Cherubini, 2014; Nelson and Valakh, 2015).\n\nIn cultured hippocampal neurons, spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents, IPSCs, were recorded from EGFP and EGFP plus scFv-geph NLS transfected pyramidal neurons. Gephyrin-specific single chain antibody fragments (scFv-gephyrin) were expressed as a fusion protein containing a nuclear localization signal (scFv-geph NLS), to efficiently and selectively remove endogenous gephyrin from synapses and retarget it away into the nucleus. Spontaneus events were reversibly blocked by bicuculline (10 μM), indicating that they were GABAA receptor-mediated currents (n=6). The mean sIPSCs frequency was 1.4 ± 0.1 Hz in controls (n=10) and 0.6 ± 0.2 Hz in the presence of scFV-gephyrin NLS (n=7). The mean sIPSCs amplitude was 156.4 ± 30 pA in control and 75.8 ± 19.2 pA in the presence of scFV-gephyrin NLS. Both sIPSC frequency and amplitude were significantly different between control and scFV-gephyrin NLS conditions (p=0.005 and p=0.036, respectively). These data suggest that hampering gephyrin function by the relocalization of the protein into the nucleus alters GABAergic neurotransmission.\n\n\nAndjus, P R, Stevic‐Marinkovic, Z and Cherubini E (1997) Immunoglobulins from motoneurone disease patients enhance glutamate release from rat hippocampal neurones in culture.

This analysis is derived from microscopic brain images taken from 12 driver-reporter constructs (DOIs for source data sets are specified in data descriptor file listed below; hbp-00170\\_Comparative\\_DataDescriptor\\_v1p1.txt) in which the different promoters regulate the expression of the E. coli derived LacZ reporter gene encoding β-galactosidase, visualized histologically using X-gal (5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside) as a substrate. Labelling was observed in microscopic images that were spatially registered to the Allen Mouse Common Coordinate Framework (v2; mouse.brain-map.org). The density of labeling was assessed by two independent researchers using a semi-quantitative grading system from 0 – 4, introduced in Yetman et al., Brain Struct Funct 221:2231-49, 2016. Here grade 0 represents absence of labeled cells (less than 1 per 0.01 mm2), grade 1 - low density (few cells, possible to count), grade 2 - medium density (several cells that can be individually discerned, but not readily counted), grade 3 - high density (many labeled cells with large degree of overlap), and grade 4 - very high density (where individual cells cannot be discerned). For each promoter-tTA line one representative case was semi-quantitatively scored and results verified in the other cases. Scores did not vary more than 1 grade between cases or researchers in any regions. The highest numbers were reported. If the density of labeling was found to vary substantially within a region, the highest observed score was recorded.",

      "description": "This dataset contains cytoarchitectonic maps of Area hOc1 (V1, 17, CalcS) in the BigBrain dataset [Amunts et al. 2013]. The mappings were created using the semi-automatic method presented in Schleicher et al. 1999, based on coronal histological sections on 1 micron resolution. Mappings are available on every 60th section of the visual system. They were then transformed to the sections of the 3D reconstructed BigBrain space using the transformations used in Amunts et al. 2013, which were provided by Claude Lepage (McGill).\n\nFor this brain area, a highly detailed 3D map has been computed based on automatic delineations in every histological section from a novel Deep Learning algorithm.
