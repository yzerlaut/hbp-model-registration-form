      "description": "The BigBrain dataset is a key element of the HBP Human Brain Atlas, representing a structural representation of the cytoarchitectonic of the human brain with the highest isotropic resolution currently available. So far, the dataset has been used in two cytoarchitectonic mapping projects. From these two projects the Te1.0, Te1.1, Te1.2, Te2.1, Te2.2, Te3, TI1, TI2, and TPJ cortical subregions of the auditory cortex were transformed into BigBrain space. To do this, the border information was measured and extracted in successive stained histological sections of the original distorted dataset, at a layer distance of up to 0.3mm as contour line data. We computed new linear and nonlinear transformations from the original distorted sections to the final repaired and corrected sections of the 3D reconstructed BigBrain dataset, because it would have been much more complicated—and thus error-prone—to combine the large number of individual transformations which have been computed for the original 3D reconstruction of the BigBrain. The newly computed transformations were applied to the contour line data, quality controlled, and shared with the EPFL team for the purpose of integrating the delineations of the auditory cortex into the BigBrain viewer of the Collaboratory.\nIn addition, efforts were carried out to achieve a match of the ontologies used for the cytoarchitectonic JuBrain atlas and the Collaboratory/Unified Portal data.\nThe cytoarchitectonic delineations of the auditory cortex are based on observer-independent histological mapping performed in the stained histological sections of the first BigBrain dataset at an in-plane resolution of 1μm. The delineations were transferred to the reconstructed histological sections at a resolution of 20μm. Details of the histological processing and 3D reconstruction of the BigBrain dataset have been extensively described in Amunts et al., 2012, and the approach for observer-independent delineation of brain regions is summarised in several peer-reviewed publications [Zilles et al., 2002; Schleicher et al., 2005].",

      "description": "The visual search task (MCSE) is the adaptation of a classical visual search test by Treisman and Gelade (1980). Each stimulus consisted of an array of 36 letters (6 X 6 square arrays with 35 tilted Ls and one T, all letters with independently and randomly tilted). Participants were instructed to find the letter « T » as fast as possible and press one of two response buttons to report its position in the upper (right index finger) or lower (right middle finger) part of the array. Two main experimental conditions were contrasted: an easy search (pop out) and a difficult (sustained) search condition (see Ossandon et al., 2011). In the easy condition, the target was grey and all distractors were black, while in the difficult condition, all letters were grey. The difficult and easy condition stimuli were intermixed randomly, with 48 trials for each condition and an inter stimulus interval of 4s between consecutive array onsets. Arrays were shown for 3 seconds and participants were encouraged to respond as fast as possible, while keeping their gaze on the center of the array. All task sessions took place in patients' hospital rooms. Stimuli were presented to the participants on a 17 inch computer screen at a 60 cm viewing distance. The arrays subtended 6x6 degrees of visual angle. Stimuli were delivered using the stimulus delivery software Presentation (Neurobehavioral systems Inc).",

      "description": "The JuBrain cytoarchitectonic atlas consists of probabilistic maps for human brain structures defined by histological analysis of ten post-mortem brains. The individual maps are furthermore combined into a Maximum probability Map that assigns each voxel in the brain to the most likely histological area at that particular position. This cytoarchitectonic atlas is a key element of the HBP Human Brain Atlas, representing the most detailed miro-structural parcellation of the cortex currently available. It is of utmost relevance for functional and cognitive neuroscientists to localize their findings and activations patterns in a common structural framework, and thus helps bridging the gap between function and structure by allowing an objective integration of in-vivo data with histological findings using quantitative tools (Eickhoff et al., 2005, 2007). To date the atlas contains 60 structures, which are ready for a public data release, since each of them is described and published in peer-reviewed journals. For roughly the same number of additional structures, histological mapping has already been completed, but the data is not yet completely analysed and published. Finally, around 90 further structures are currently being mapped. The cytoarchitectonic maps are based on observer-independent histological mapping performed in 10 human post-mortem brains. These brains were obtained via the body donor program of the Department of Anatomy at the University of Düsseldorf, Germany as approved by the local ethics committee. Details on the histological processing have been extensively described in peer-reviewed publications (e.g., Amunts et al., 1999, 2004; Zilles et al., 2002), the approach for observer-independent delineation of brain regions is summarized in (Zilles et al., 2002; Schleicher et al., 2005) and detailed specifically for each particular brain structure in the associated journal publication. Following 3D reconstruction of the histological volumes and spatial normalization into a common template space (cf. above) as described in detail in (Amunts et al., 2004), the individual maps of structures in the different brains are superimposed to create probabilistic maps. These map describe, how likely that particular structure is found at each voxel of the reference space. Finally, as a summary of these individual maps into a distinct whole-brain parcellation, a Maximum probability Map is computed that assigns each voxel in the brain to the most likely histological area at that particular position (Eickhoff et al., 2005, 2006).",

      "description": "The BigBrain dataset is a key element of the HBP Human Brain Atlas, representing a structural representation of the cytoarchitectonic of the human brain with the highest isotropic resolution currently available. So far, the dataset has been used in two cytoarchitectonic mapping projects. From these two projects the Te1.0, Te1.1, Te1.2, Te2.1, Te2.2, Te3, TI1, TI2, and TPJ cortical subregions of the auditory cortex were transformed into BigBrain space. To do this, the border information was measured and extracted in successive stained histological sections of the original distorted dataset, at a layer distance of up to 0.3mm as contour line data. We computed new linear and nonlinear transformations from the original distorted sections to the final repaired and corrected sections of the 3D reconstructed BigBrain dataset, because it would have been much more complicated—and thus error-prone—to combine the large number of individual transformations which have been computed for the original 3D reconstruction of the BigBrain. The newly computed transformations were applied to the contour line data, quality controlled, and shared with the EPFL team for the purpose of integrating the delineations of the auditory cortex into the BigBrain viewer of the Collaboratory.\nIn addition, efforts were carried out to achieve a match of the ontologies used for the cytoarchitectonic JuBrain atlas and the Collaboratory/Unified Portal data. \nThe cytoarchitectonic delineations of the auditory cortex are based on observer-independent histological mapping performed in the stained histological sections of the first BigBrain dataset at an in-plane resolution of 1μm. The delineations were transferred to the reconstructed histological sections at a resolution of 20μm. Details of the histological processing and 3D reconstruction of the BigBrain dataset have been extensively described in Amunts et al., 2012, and the approach for observer-independent delineation of brain regions is summarised in several peer-reviewed publications [Zilles et al., 2002; Schleicher et al., 2005].",

Continuous iEEG signals were first re-referenced to their nearest contact site (bipolar reference, e.g. “f4” becomes “f4-f3” for contact site f4, immediate neighbor of f3 3.5 mm away on the same electrode shaft) then bandpass-filtered in ten consecutive 10-Hz-wide frequency bands (e.g., 10 bands, beginning with 50–60 Hz up to 140–150 Hz). Next, we computed the envelope of each of the ten bandpass filtered signals using a standard Hilbert transform. The resulting envelopes were then downsampled to a time resolution of 15.625 ms between consecutive samples (64 Hz). Then, for each band, that envelope was divided by its mean value across the entire recording session and multiplied by 100 (which means that the values are now expressed in % of the mean envelope value across the entire recording). Finally, the envelope signals computed for each consecutive frequency bands (e.g., 10 bands of 10 Hz intervals between 50 and 150 Hz) were averaged together, to provide one single time-series (named “High-Frequency Activity of HFA[50-150 Hz]) across the entire session. By construction, the mean value of that time-series across the recording session is equal to 100.",

      "description": "The setting of an atlas of human brain function plays a key role in the HBP, as it will provide top-down constraints on the functional and structural organization of future brain simulations. The available technology makes it possible to build such an atlas from measurements at the mm scale using non-invasive imaging (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, associated with other MRI measurements). The Individual Brain Charting task is addressing this challenge, based on the combination of two strategies: \n1. Gather and integrate all existing cognitive data into a model of brain functional organization. For this, we will gather all freely available data (Human Connectome Project, OpenfMRI, archi and NeuroVault; Gorgolewski et al, 2015) into a consistent framework that associates these data with relevant annotation.  The crux is the statistical analysis of these data (meta-analysis, that relies on machine learning), which involves computational aspects (tractability of the learning procedures: Varoquaux et al, 2013), sophisticated machine learning tools (supervised learning; Schwartz et al, 2013, Thirion et al, 2014b, Schwartz et al, submitted) and statistical problems (model selection; Thirion et al, 2014). The analysis of these data is currently bringing new insights on the network-level organization of brain function (Bzdok et al, submitted) and functional segregation of the brain (Schwartz et al, submitted).\n2. Acquire new, better quality and higher resolution data to gain an order of magnitude in our description of brain functional circuits. This relies on considering individual acquisition in a small group (12) of subjects that will be scanned in a vast amount of situations during the duration of the project (10 acquisitions during the ramp-up phase). We are currently finalizing the ethical and administrative aspects of this study, and running the first inclusion scans. In a pilot study (Thirion et al, 2014a), we have already shown that an important fraction of cross-subject variability could be captured by the response to functional localizer experiments, showing that a sharper characterization of brain function would be obtained by systematic intra-subject mapping.\nThe resources represented by these two approaches will be further developed and analysed jointly in the course of the project.\nOur first deliverable is the open-source Nilearn toolbox (http://nilearn.github.io/ release 0.1 in 01/2015) that provides the necessary functions to upload these data easily, organize them to enter machine learning analyses, perform efficiently various kinds of estimation, write and visualize the results. Note that Nilearn relies on the reference Scikit-learn and joblib libraries developed by us and widely used by the Neuroinformatics platform of HBP.",

      "description": "The word recognition task (LEC1) was adapted from Mainy et al (2008). Patients were recorded under three different experimental conditions: a Control condition, a Phonological condition and a Semantic condition. In the Control condition, participants were shown series of five or six-letter consonant strings, which could not be read according to the conventional graphotactic rules of the French language (i.e., ''xwxqn''). Their task was to indicate whether the string was written in upper of lower case (50% probability for each category). In the Phonological condition, participants had to silently read five- and six-letter pseudo-words, pronounceable according to the phonotactic conventions of the French language (i.e., ''picron'') but with no obvious resemblance to known words. Their task was to determine the number of syllables included in the pseudo-word (two or three, 50% probability for each type). In the Semantic condition, participants had to judge whether five or six-letter words represented living things or not (animacy decision, 50% probability for each type). The experiment itself consisted of 12 runs. In each run, participants were presented with three blocks of five stimuli, one for each condition (Control, Phonological or Semantic). The order of the three conditions was counterbalanced between runs. The patients could take a short break and relax between two runs. Between blocks (5 stimuli of the same condition), a white cross-hair fixation point reminded participants of the condition for the block to come (coded with its precise location on a vertical axis). Strings were presented for 2000 ms, with a constant interstimulus interval (3500 ms). All stimuli (60 for each condition) were presented foveally on a 17'' computer screen, as white lower-case letters (courier font, size 36) on a light gray back-ground. Participants were instructed to respond by pressing a key with their left index finger (« Uppercase », or « Two Syllables » or « Living Entity » for the Control, Phonological and Semantic conditions respectively) or their right middle finger (« Lowerrcase », or « Three Syllables » or « Not a Living Entity »). Participants were asked not to move their tongue or lips during the tasks. All task sessions took place in patients' hospital rooms. Stimuli were presented to the participants on a 17 inch computer screen at a 60 cm viewing distance. Stimuli were delivered using the stimulus delivery software Presentation (Neurobehavioral systems Inc).",

All sounds lasted 12 seconds, and categories of sounds were a) simple sentences read in French (computer voice, French Sentence) b) the same sentences, played backwards in time (Flipped Sentences) c) simple sentences read in Suomi (Finnish, unfamiliar to participants, Suomi Sentences) d) predictable speech patterns (e.g. counting up « 1 … 2 … 3 …. » or the alphabet « a …. b …. c …. », Predictible Speech), e) human voices with no speech (Voices), e) human sounds : people crying (Crying), f) human sounds : people laughing (Laughing) g) human sounds : people yawning (Yawning), h) human sounds : people coughing (Coughing), i) instrumental music (no lyrics, Music), j) environmental sounds (e.g. cars, machines, …, Environmental), k) animal sounds (e.g. cows, horses, dogs, …. Animal). They were also three 12-s episodes of pure silence (Silence). Some of the sounds (Voices, Crying, Yawning, Laughing, Environmental and Animal) were concatenations of shorter stimuli of a functional localizer of the Temporal Voice Area ( Belin et al., 2000 ; Pernet et al., 2007 ). The 36 sounds (3 sounds of 12 categories) and 3 silent baseline periods were played consecutively, once each and in a pseudo-random order (to avoid that two sounds of the same category follow each other immediately). Participants listened to all sounds continuously with their eyes closed. The sequence was pseudorandom, to ensure that two sounds of the same category did not follow each other. All task sessions took place in patients' hospital rooms. Sounds were delivered binaurally via earphones using the stimulus delivery software Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems). All acoustic signals had the same intensity, quantified by their root mean square, and were played at a comfortable hearing level.",

In each block of the experiment, participants were presented with two intermixed stories, shown word by word at a rapid rate (one word every 700 ms, shown for 200 ms). One of the stories was written in grey (on a black screen) and the other in white. Consecutive grey words formed a meaningful and simple short story in French. Consecutive white words formed another meaningful and simple short story in French, although some of the words were interchanged between two parts of the story. Participants were instructed to read the grey story to summarize it at the end of the task, while ignoring white words. The task comprised 400 words, with 200 grey words (task-relevant, attended stimuli) and 200 white words (task-irrelevant, to-be-ignored stimuli). Color distribution within the 400 words was pseudo-randomized, so that participants could not predict whether the subsequent word was to be attended or not (but there were never more than three consecutive words of the same color). As announced, participants were told at the end of the task to summarize the story, and were also asked questions about the attended text, which could not have been answered from general knowledge. They were also asked to report anything weird they could have noticed within the white story, if they happened to read part of it unintentionally (interchanged words).

After 1500 ms, the sample stimulus was replaced by a fixation cross which stayed on screen for 3000 ms (the « retention » period). At the end of the retention period, a letter appeared for 1500 ms (the « test » stimulus) and participants had to press a key with their right index (« present ») or middle finger (« absent ») to indicate whether that letter was present of absent in the sample stimulus. There were 12 trials for each memory load (two, four or six letters). In addition, 12 trials (control condition) showed a sample stimulus with a two, four or six identical letters and # signs (i.e. « F#F### » or « H#HH#H » or « GGGGGG »), indicating that participants only had to remember that single letter (e.g. load equals « one »). There were 48 trials overall (36 + 12 controls) randomly presented during the task. All task sessions took place in patients' hospital rooms.

      "description": "The setting of an atlas of human brain function plays a key role in the HBP, as it will provide top-down constraints on the functional and structural organization of future brain simulations. The available technology makes it possible to build such an atlas from measurements at the mm scale using non-invasive imaging (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, associated with other MRI measurements). The Individual Brain Charting task is addressing this challenge, based on the combination of two strategies: \n1. Gather and integrate all existing cognitive data into a model of brain functional organization. For this, we will gather all freely available data (Human Connectome Project, OpenfMRI, archi and NeuroVault; Gorgolewski et al, 2015) into a consistent framework that associates these data with relevant annotation.  The crux is the statistical analysis of these data (meta-analysis, that relies on machine learning), which involves computational aspects (tractability of the learning procedures: Varoquaux et al, 2013), sophisticated machine learning tools (supervised learning; Schwartz et al, 2013, Thirion et al, 2014b, Schwartz et al, submitted) and statistical problems (model selection; Thirion et al, 2014). The analysis of these data is currently bringing new insights on the network-level organization of brain function (Bzdok et al, submitted) and functional segregation of the brain (Schwartz et al, submitted).\n2. Acquire new, better quality and higher resolution data to gain an order of magnitude in our description of brain functional circuits. This relies on considering individual acquisition in a small group (12) of subjects that will be scanned in a vast amount of situations during the duration of the project (10 acquisitions during the ramp-up phase). We are currently finalizing the ethical and administrative aspects of this study, and running the first inclusion scans. In a pilot study (Thirion et al, 2014a), we have already shown that an important fraction of cross-subject variability could be captured by the response to functional localizer experiments, showing that a sharper characterization of brain function would be obtained by systematic intra-subject mapping.\nThe resources represented by these two approaches will be further developed and analysed jointly in the course of the project.\nOur first deliverable is the open-source Nilearn toolbox (http://nilearn.github.io/ release 0.1 in 01/2015) that provides the necessary functions to upload these data easily, organize them to enter machine learning analyses, perform efficiently various kinds of estimation, write and visualize the results. Note that Nilearn relies on the reference Scikit-learn and joblib libraries developed by us and widely used by the Neuroinformatics platform of HBP.",

The 2015 release is based on the January 2015 alignment with global b-spline optical-balancing as the major achievement. The alignment is much smoother than in the 2013 release, albeit not perfect given the strong distortions in the raw images. The model looks really great now. The tissue classified volumes have been supplied. We are currently working the extraction of the cortical surfaces\nand registration to MNI ICBM152 space and MNI ADNI space (coming soon).  Segmentation of deep brain structures is under way for this model. Contributions will be added to the Release as they become available.",

      "description": "The setting of an atlas of human brain function plays a key role in the HBP, as it will provide top-down constraints on the functional and structural organization of future brain simulations. The available technology makes it possible to build such an atlas from measurements at the mm scale using non-invasive imaging (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, associated with other MRI measurements). The Individual Brain Charting task is addressing this challenge, based on the combination of two strategies: \n1. Gather and integrate all existing cognitive data into a model of brain functional organization. For this, we will gather all freely available data (Human Connectome Project, OpenfMRI, archi and NeuroVault; Gorgolewski et al, 2015) into a consistent framework that associates these data with relevant annotation.  The crux is the statistical analysis of these data (meta-analysis, that relies on machine learning), which involves computational aspects (tractability of the learning procedures: Varoquaux et al, 2013), sophisticated machine learning tools (supervised learning; Schwartz et al, 2013, Thirion et al, 2014b, Schwartz et al, submitted) and statistical problems (model selection; Thirion et al, 2014). The analysis of these data is currently bringing new insights on the network-level organization of brain function (Bzdok et al, submitted) and functional segregation of the brain (Schwartz et al, submitted).\n2. Acquire new, better quality and higher resolution data to gain an order of magnitude in our description of brain functional circuits. This relies on considering individual acquisition in a small group (12) of subjects that will be scanned in a vast amount of situations during the duration of the project (10 acquisitions during the ramp-up phase). We are currently finalizing the ethical and administrative aspects of this study, and running the first inclusion scans. In a pilot study (Thirion et al, 2014a), we have already shown that an important fraction of cross-subject variability could be captured by the response to functional localizer experiments, showing that a sharper characterization of brain function would be obtained by systematic intra-subject mapping.\nThe resources represented by these two approaches will be further developed and analysed jointly in the course of the project.\nOur first deliverable is the open-source Nilearn toolbox (http://nilearn.github.io/ release 0.1 in 01/2015) that provides the necessary functions to upload these data easily, organize them to enter machine learning analyses, perform efficiently various kinds of estimation, write and visualize the results. Note that Nilearn relies on the reference Scikit-learn and joblib libraries developed by us and widely used by the Neuroinformatics platform of HBP.",

So far, the dataset has been used in two cytoarchitectonic mapping projects. From these two projects the Te1.0, Te1.1, Te1.2, Te2.1, Te2.2, Te3, TI1, TI2, and TPJ cortical subregions of the auditory cortex were transformed into BigBrain space. To do this, the border information was measured and extracted in successive stained histological sections of the original distorted dataset, at a layer distance of up to 0.3mm as contour line data. We computed new linear and nonlinear transformations from the original distorted sections to the final repaired and corrected sections of the 3D reconstructed BigBrain dataset, because it would have been much more complicated—and thus error-prone—to combine the large number of individual transformations which have been computed for the original 3D reconstruction of the BigBrain. The newly computed transformations were applied to the contour line data, quality controlled, and shared with the EPFL team for the purpose of integrating the delineations of the auditory cortex into the BigBrain viewer of the Collaboratory.\nIn addition, efforts were carried out to achieve a match of the ontologies used for the cytoarchitectonic JuBrain atlas and the Collaboratory/Unified Portal data. \nThe cytoarchitectonic delineations of the auditory cortex are based on observer-independent histological mapping performed in the stained histological sections of the first BigBrain dataset at an in-plane resolution of 1μm. The delineations were transferred to the reconstructed histological sections at a resolution of 20μm. Details of the histological processing and 3D reconstruction of the BigBrain dataset have been extensively described in Amunts et al., 2012, and the approach for observer-independent delineation of brain regions is summarised in several peer-reviewed publications [Zilles et al., 2002; Schleicher et al., 2005].",

      "description": "The JuBrain cytoarchitectonic atlas consists of probabilistic maps for human brain structures defined by histological analysis of ten post-mortem brains. The individual maps are furthermore combined into a Maximum probability Map that assigns each voxel in the brain to the most likely histological area at that particular position. This cytoarchitectonic atlas is a key element of the HBP Human Brain Atlas, representing the most detailed miro-structural parcellation of the cortex currently available. It is of utmost relevance for functional and cognitive neuroscientists to localize their findings and activations patterns in a common structural framework, and thus helps bridging the gap between function and structure by allowing an objective integration of in-vivo data with histological findings using quantitative tools (Eickhoff et al., 2005, 2007). To date the atlas contains 60 structures, which are ready for a public data release, since each of them is described and published in peer-reviewed journals. For roughly the same number of additional structures, histological mapping has already been completed, but the data is not yet completely analysed and published. Finally, around 90 further structures are currently being mapped. The cytoarchitectonic maps are based on observer-independent histological mapping performed in 10 human post-mortem brains. These brains were obtained via the body donor program of the Department of Anatomy at the University of Düsseldorf, Germany as approved by the local ethics committee. Details on the histological processing have been extensively described in peer-reviewed publications (e.g., Amunts et al., 1999, 2004; Zilles et al., 2002), the approach for observer-independent delineation of brain regions is summarized in (Zilles et al., 2002; Schleicher et al., 2005) and detailed specifically for each particular brain structure in the associated journal publication. Following 3D reconstruction of the histological volumes and spatial normalization into a common template space (cf. above) as described in detail in (Amunts et al., 2004), the individual maps of structures in the different brains are superimposed to create probabilistic maps. These map describe, how likely that particular structure is found at each voxel of the reference space. Finally, as a summary of these individual maps into a distinct whole-brain parcellation, a Maximum probability Map is computed that assigns each voxel in the brain to the most likely histological area at that particular position (Eickhoff et al., 2005, 2006).",

      "description": "Experiments were performed at the Unité de Neurosciences, Information et Complexité (CNRS, France). Experimental procedures with animals were performed following the instructions of the European Council Directive 2010/63/EU and its French transposition (Décret 2013/118). Swiss wild‐type mice of either sex, 8–13 days old, were anaesthetized with inhaled isoflurane and decapitated, their brain was rapidly removed and immersed in cold ‘cutting’ solution (∼4 °C) containing the following (in mm): 110 choline chloride, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 8 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, pH equilibrated to 7.3 with O2–CO2 (95%–5%). Coronal slices (300 μm thick) were prepared with a vibratome (Leica VT1200 S, Leica Microsystems) and stored at room temperature in oxygenated aCSF containing the following (in mm): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.5 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2 and 10 glucose, pH 7.4. The slices were then transferred to the recording chamber (perfused with the same solution) where the temperature was maintained at 34°C. Slices containing primary visual cortex were taken as the first four slices containing brain cortex starting from the most caudal one. \n\nWe performed intracellular recordings of visually identified pyramidal cells located in the layer V of mouse cortex using the perforated‐patch technique.\nPatch electrodes (tip resistance: 1.5–2.5 MΩ) were pulled on a Sutter P‐1000 apparatus (Sutter Instruments) and filled in a two step procedure. The pipettes were pre‐filled with a solution containing the following (in mm): 130 potassium gluconate, KCl 7, NaCl 1, MgCl2 4, Hepes 10, pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH (osmolarity 260 mOsm). The pipette was then back‐filled with the same solution to which was added Amphotericin‐B (Sigma Aldrich) previously dissolved in DMSO, the final concentration of Amphotericin‐B was 60 μm. The reason for this two‐step procedure is to allow a current flow out of the pipette (to preserve the tip from dirt) without pouring the perforant onto the target cell during the pipette approach. The perforation could therefore happen only after diffusion of Amphotericin‐B through the ‘clean’ solution, this usually took 5–10 min after the pipette filling, thus allowing the cell‐attached configuration to form in absence of the perforant molecule at the pipette's tip.\n\nTo determine the input impedance at the soma, we injected sinusoidal currents in the current-clamp mode of the amplifier (Multiclamp 700B, Molecular Devices), we recorded the membrane potential response to a current input of the form (t) = I sin (2πft), we varied the frequencies f and amplitudes I over 40 episodes per cell. The frequency range scanned was [0.1, 500] Hz. For each cell, we determined manually the current amplitude I0 that gave a ∼5mV amplitude in a current step protocol, from this value, the value of I was scaled exponentially between I0 at 0.1 Hz and 50 I0 at 500Hz. The reason for varying the current amplitude (and not only the oscillation frequency) in those input impedance protocols is to anticipate for the low pass filtering of the membrane and insure that the membrane potential response at high frequencies is far above the electronic noise level ∼ 0.1 mV.\n\nThe phase and amplitude of the membrane impedance was determined as follows. After removing the first 3 periods of the oscillations (to avoid transient effects), we fitted the membrane potential response to the form: V(t) = EL + R I sin(2πft − ϕ), where EL, R and ϕ were fitted with a least-square minimization procedure (using a Nelder-Mead minimization, implemented in the “minimize” function from the “optimize” module of SciPy, the tolerance for termination “tol” was set to 1e-6).",

Visual stimuli were gray-scale pictures presented foveally within an oval aperture (all pictures had the same average luminance). They were drawn from nine categories: houses, faces, animals, landscapes, objects, pronounceable French pseudo-words, unpronounceable consonant-strings, scrambled images and fruits (target items). No stimulus was presented more than once. Stimuli were presented for 200 ms every 1000-1200 ms in series of 5 pictures interleaved with 3-s pause periods during which participants could freely blink. Participants reported the detection of targets by manually pressing a joystick button with their right index finger and received a visual feedback immediately after (hit, miss or false alarm). A 2-s delay after each button press allowed participants to re-focus after each button press. Visual categories were distributed randomly across the experiment, with 50 pictures of each category, each shown only once. All task sessions took place in patients' hospital rooms. Stimuli were presented to the participants on a 17 inch computer screen at a 60 cm viewing distance and pictures subtended 3 degrees of visual angle. Stimuli were delivered using the stimulus delivery software Presentation (Neurobehavioral systems Inc).",
